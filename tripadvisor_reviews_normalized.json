A good location for us in the High Street.  The special offer I booked included a cocktail in the bar.  There was a good choice and it is evidently a popular spot locally as it was busy.  The only disappointment was breakfast which wasn\u2019t worth the cost.  The items we ate tasted rather cheap, nor did we get quite what we ordered.",

Our warm quiet  room  was very well furnished and decorated, with attention to detail. It overlooked a garden terrace, well lit and quiet in  stormy December\n\n Staff were very warm friendly and welcoming. The pride with which our room was cared for by  housekeepers was noticeable. All that we used was  refilled each day. Delivering fresh milk to our room each morning was a lovely touch.\n\n The breakfast menu was large and varied and again staff were very attentive to guests needs. We were able to linger and avoid the storms,  as there was plenty of space to accommodate all residents.\nThe bars were busy early in the evening but once casual dinners departed the hubbub subsided. We  enjoyed drinking in The Salt bar with its  log  burning  stove, although prices were on the high side.\nOver our long weekend we only dined in the hotel once. The meal was excellent and the portions substantial. Good value for money given the quality on offer.\n\nWe loved our brief say in Lymington and plan to return to the excellent Stanwell House Hotel  in the year to come.",

    "review_text": "=== Country style hotel in the town with some exceptional aspects ===\nHotel was straight forward to find but as many have noted finding and getting into the car park is a bit of a challenge.  The staff try their best to guide you but the map provided could do with being more focused on the local area.\nThe overall vibe of the hotel is a posh country style, open and light with great wallpaper and overall decor scheme is lovely.  Although am sure we booked an 'attic' room we were given the key to a garden room over looking the side view / garden.  Room was furnished well - fantastic and comfortable large bed, small wardrobe, seating with a table and dresser.  Bathroom was well appointed in an 'edwardian' style of fittings with a large walk-in shower.  The room though was very warm initially and we tried the air-con which didn't seem to work and the window had restricted opening.  The supplied beverages and shortbread were of a very high quality and fresh milk supplied.  Minor note, like many hotels, there were no plates for the biscuits and prefer to be able to drop the tea bags onto a small dish vs the bin (really personal preference).  The side window also let in the direct sun, which was strong and low and the room would have benefitted from a roller or other type of privacy blind). The curtains were luxurious too but too early to close them!\n\nHad a quick look around the High Street before returning for another cuppa and getting ready to go out (had booked at a local restaurant for a special event but would have liked to try out the hotels menu too).  As we had the inclusive cocktail package we indulged in the Salt bar with two lovely made cocktails by the bar staff and provided with a small snack of pop-corn too.\n\nWith such a comfortable bed and quiet location had a good nights sleep.  The shower had quite a limited flow - not sure if that was just our room or a general issue.\n\nWe were quite late to breakfast but this overall was a really good spread.  The buffet part had some good selections (although we didn't see any of the homemade granola - but there was enough other choice).  The coffee ordered was just about perfect - so much so we had some later in the day....\n\nHot food choices were good and other guests seem to say the same.  My wifes poached eggs were perfectly runny on the avo / sour dough bread.  Full English was excellent and in particular the black pudding was not a type had before - so we asked our server to find out the supplier and will be using this in the future.  Some aspects of the breakfast service was a little slow but Tina did a great job and it seemed they were a little under staffed.\n\nCheckout all went well and we left the car in the parking place to explore a but further.  Before we left we couldn't resist some further cake and another of the excellent coffee and the luxury hot chocolate.  Will be planning a return trip for more than one night!!\n\nThere were a few issues the hotel need to address - would say 4.5 stars really - hoping you can get to 5 next time.",

    "review_text": "=== Loved it. ===\nIt was our first visit to this pretty small town which acts as one of the ferry ports to the Isle of Wight . The hotel is situ. on the main high street (which is a hill at the hotel end)  and the town itself is charming, with a quaint 5 min walk from the hotel to the quayside. \nWe loved this boutique hotel as it had an intimate feel. The staff service was efficient, professional and friendly.  Our room (1st floor - no lift) and the food was 'quality'.  We booked this hotel for 4 nights B&B (offer 4 nights for 3) after visiting the hotel reception 10 weeks earlier and inspecting the type of room we then chose to book. All the staff were very friendly and happy and the decor. of the hotel (which we loved) clearly reflects a full and extensive refurbishment 2 yrs prior (as told by the locals).  We did have one meal out to a popular and recommended restaurant, which made a nice change, but the food wasn't as good as the hotels. There is a 12% service charge for the evening meal, but you get what you pay for. My only learn from the visit is that if you like to keep a track of your 'spending' whilst at the hotel, always ask for a copy receipt (which is not normally provided), as the total invoice presented at the end of our stay was not 'user friendly'!\nThe hotel car park close by is a bit of daily gamble, as there are only 12 car spaces available on a 'first come' basis. However, there's a council long-stay car park literally adjacent.  We enjoyed free parking whilst there, but in the summer months, that would be unlikely. \nWill be returning again - absolutely - 'can't wait'!",

This was our second visit in a week and we were delighted with the little welcome treat that was waiting for us. The reason for such a quick return to the hotel was the quality of food in Beresfords restaurant.  Last week my husband enjoyed a perfectly cooked loin of venison but when he tasted my  braised ox cheek, he suffered from food envy, so we had to return just so he could enjoy the dish himself!! We both had it this time and the meat just melts in the mouth and had perfect accompaniments.  The location is excellent with pleasant walks in the forest close by. The staff are well-trained and help provide a welcoming experience from the moment you walk through the door. Of particular note are Chloe and Tracy. Chloe served us in the bar and restaurant on both occasions and was knowledgeable about the menu and had a fun personality. Tracy served us at breakfast both times and dealt well with an issue we had with the breakfast on the first visit. The young lady (Amy?) who checked us in yesterday took a lot of trouble in checking that ox cheek was on the menu! The lady on reception today told us about a 3-mile walk in the forest directly from the hotel so we will definitely return to do that as well as to enjoy the excellent food and peaceful location.",

Whilst our room was very cosy and comfortable the windows are single glazed so even when shut we could hear traffic and people talking outside well into the night/early morning. We could also hear people in the room above us. The hotel has loads of character and we found all the staff to be very friendly and welcoming. We had dinner in the Samphire Restaurant and the Salt Bar. The food menu is the same throughout the hotel and the dishes we had were well presented and very tasty. The fish pie was particularly good and the gnocchi.  The breakfast was excellent with plenty of choice and good quality ingredients. We would also recommend the Kings Arms in the old part of Lymington and The Haven Restaurant overlooking the marina. We very much enjoyed our stay but would probably not have a room at the front of the hotel if we visited again.",

Mains were superb - 2 of our party said the fish pie was the best they had ever eaten. My lobster macaroni was delicious and the risotto excellent.  Dessert menu did not have anything we fancied - nothing chocolate based, lemony or toffee based to tempt us.  Great coffee though.  We sat down at 1:30, long waiting times meant that our main courses came out at 3:30 which was later than we would have wanted - but we didn\u2019t really mind.

The air conditioning unit rattled and the hot water made noises on and off through the night. Needless to say we did not sleep, which, as someone who can usually sleep anywhere, is saying a lot.\n\nWe were so disappointed as we had come away as a birthday treat and to have a proper night sleep away from two little ones.

Bed, lovely, good linens and a nice soft topper on a quality mattress.  Bathroom good.  Could do with a magnifying mirror though (especially for contact lens wearers) and the floor needs a bit of a bleach as it\u2019s a little bit grey now.

Overall we really could not fault the evening and had a wonderful time. We arrived a little early but were welcomed at reception and given a map so that we could do a quick walk in the forest direct from the hotel whilst our room was being prepared. This is a great bonus - the walk is around 90 mins if you do it all and so beautiful! We were allocated a room with a lovely forest view on the third floor - it was spacious and comfy (the receptionist moved us to this floor at our request there is a lift so only one step to navigate!) We made a cuppa in our room (all provided by the hotel) and then changed into swimsuits and robes to go and enjoy the leisure pool/jacuzzi/sauna. There were a few others in there and I had to pop back to reception to get towels and to the spa to get slippers, - but all staff were very happy to help with this, so no issues. On our way back up to our room later we completed a wine and fizz order on specially prepared leaflets which we posted in a post box. Great idea and so organised! The evening started with champagne and candles at 6.30 - and we met other diners all dressed up in black tie and sparkles etc. There wasn\u2019t enough seating out at this point- but actually this forced us to chat to other people which was really good. There was a great atmosphere. We then had a delicious relaxing meal - lots of courses and very tasty food. Well done to the chefs for getting out so many meals on time and perfectly cooked! By the time we finished eating it was around 9 ish and we then had seats around a dance floor with a DJ playing lots of nostalgic music. There was now lots of seating out, a Photo Booth (brilliant fun with lots of hats glasses feathers etc to parade in whilst the camera counted down and snapped away) and a room with casino games in. We whiled away the time to midnight by dancing / spending our \u2018monopoly\u2019 money and taking pics. The time flew by with lots of laughter and fun and fizz. Such a fab night and then bacon rolls were bought out to keep us going till 1 am. The staff were brilliant throughout and really well led by the manager Tom who was very hands on and helpful ( even finding me party poppers when I left mine in the restaurant!) overall a 10 out of 10 - and topped off with a good breakfast in the morning. We will definitely return to this hotel - after March when the manager shared the spa will be renovated and extended with new facilities.",

We are not milkmen and don't remember those early timings in previous years. It seems somewhat early especially on a weekend. \nForest Park Hotel and The Huntsman put the sausages away at 10.30 and 11.00.\nWe even ordered in room breakfast for the 09.30 - 10.00 slot and it came at 09.15!!\nIt was good to get home, only for a lie in......",

My husband managed to stop the leak as maintenance were not working and we left the inter connecting room drying out so all was sorted nice and quickly. \n\nThe rooms were lovely, being at the end of a corridor was ideal although those stairs after dinner felt like a workout ;-)\n\nThe food and drink were exceptional! As someone with a food intolerance I cannot fault the team, so much attention to detail, a call in advance from the restaurant manager to check in with me and follow up emails to make sure I had the right options. Throughout our stay the staff knew I had an intolerance so knew to bring me oat milk and came and found with me with a tray of dairy free canap\u00e9s which was a lovely touch. \n\nThe manager (I think his name was Tom) was great, made sure he checked in with every table on Boxing Day and stopped to chat with all the guests. \n\nThe staff were all lovely, really great team! I did feel for them on Christmas Day as a couple of guests were not that kind to them but they just kept smiling! Well done to them all.\n\nThe night porter was fabulous, my daughter had an asthma attack on Christmas Eve and despite being busy resetting the hotel after a fire alarm he took time to get stuff I needed and came and checked she was ok the next morning. \n\nThis was our second festive break at Balmer lawn and we hope to be back again for another. \n\nThank you!",

The table allocated had to be made bigger for the party size and was not low level as I\u2019d asked for a few times with disabled parents when\nbooking. Food tasty but not like the amazing buffet two years back when we last came or service. Sadly the buffet area was not looked after, so no bowls or extra cutlery and food bits everywhere especially on the fruit salad / bread area. \nMale toilets not cleaned regularly and towels dropped on floor still there two hours later. I removed a blockage from the sink. \nDespite the fact I had spent nearly \u00a3550 on the buffet and drinks, two of the party tried to get coffee at the end in a smaller table area, after the buffet finished whilst waiting for the EV charger. Eventually taken to the snug by a waiter which was empty, but then informed by another waiter, as they were not guests they couldn\u2019t order?? Gave up and sat in the car. \nSadly this will be our last year. Even though staff friendly, the service and delivery didn\u2019t meet the expectations from previous visit, which is a real shame.

The dining room was beautiful with the tables being well spaced with very comfortable chairs. The young staff were exceptionally polite without being gushing. (Chewton Glen quality). We chose our beverages and courses easily and I asked for my meal to be modified because of an intolerance. The trout starter was small but the quality of the trout was outstanding. A great introduction to the main course. The main courses were outstanding. As good as I have ever tasted. The beef was rare, just as I had requested and more than that, it tasted like beef of my childhood. It was delicious! The whole carrots were just cooked (correct) with a light butter glaze as were the parsnips. I chose not to have roast potatoes and Yorkshire but my husband had plenty and he reported that the Yorkshire actually tasted 'home made' All of this was accompanied by fresh cabbage and cauliflower cheese. Even the gravy was full of taste. My husband's plate was groaning with well cooked food and even he had a little trouble 'putting it away' and definitely required a brisk walk after. I did notice that all the diners around the dining room cleared their plates with alacrity. The service was discrete but excellent. We came out vowing to make a point of going there for the occasional Sunday Lunch again.

We explained at the point of booking and again on arrival, that we would be using a Christmas voucher.  We handed the voucher to the receptionist.  At no point did anyone suggest that we needed to use the full credit for that meal.  When the bill arrived, the calculation was \u00a329 more than the correct amount.  The couple on the next table had the same experience.  The bill was returned corrected, but it was \u00a319 below the value of the voucher.  We were then informed for the first time that we would lose this credit.  After a short discussion, having been told by our delightful, smiley waiter that 'it was management policy' we were given two choices. Either pay the full bill ourselves or lose the \u00a319.  We chose to pay and were told that we could return at any time to use the full amount on the voucher.\nObviously, it was a disappointing end to a lovely birthday treat from our family.  During covid there had been another difficulty with a voucher which was about to run out because the hotel had been closed for a long period.  The young Polish lady on that occasion was very reluctant to extend the date.  That was a while ago and the new staff are all absolutely delightful and most helpful. We do hope that it will  be third time lucky!!",

A bit chaotic with booking in, being given a drink, waiting around for someone to show us to our table and trying to find somewhere to sit to enjoy our drink.\nOnce seated I noted how low the seating was, thankfully there was a cushion to sit on, if you're short you might struggle.\nWe had a tasty array of nibbles to start with, were presented with the wine list and it did take some time for wine to arrive. Our pre-ordered starter arrived and it was very tasty and beautifully presented. We opted for the duck cooked three ways. I chose the monk fish for the main and I'm glad I did. Light and served with a sauce that was a bit rich but tasty in all. My partner opted for traditional turkey and he was pleasently surprised by the portion size (needless to say we ended up bringing leftovers). Had the panna cotta to finish with and despite it being light I was sated and couldn't manage to finish it. Sadly we were too full for coffee.\nAll in all we did enjoy it and we're glad it didn't last for hours. Christmas meals under previous owners have seen us trying to leave after five hours.\nSadly lacking in disabled fascilities. I appreciate this is a listed building but arrangements could be made to accommodate.\nQuite expensive at \u00a395 a head but worth it as a treat.",

From the moment we checked in, we were greeted by a very welcoming member of staff at check in. We arrived early and were pleased to be told our room was ready. And what a room it was. We stayed in Room 29, a stunning room overlooking the lovely garden to the rear with its own private balcony. We booked in for dinner at the Samphire restaurant and were very much looking forward to a wonderful dining experience and we were not disappointed! We shared a mixture of \u2018nibbles\u2019 from the menu to start and we both went for the Venison saddle for our main. Absolutely amazing! And we made sure we saved room for dessert after reading so many positive reviews and we were so glad we did! My husband chose the Treacle Tart, his favourite dessert, and he absolutely loved it- best one he\u2019s ever tasted apparently! I went for the warm chocolate cookie with salted caramel ice cream- just wow! My husband was then treated to an extra dessert as a surprise for his birthday, very thoughtful indeed. \nA special mention to the lovely member of staff that served us at dinner, Abbie,  who was very attentive throughout and who also gave us a complimentary bottle of wine as a Happy Birthday from the hotel. \nWe couldn\u2019t have asked for a better experience. Thank you to all staff at Stanwell House Hotel who made our stay so special. We highly recommend the Samphire restaurant and always make sure you save room for pudding!!",

    "review_text": "=== Beautiful place and wonderful staff ===\nVisited in September - a last minute booking as my plans had changed quite suddenly whilst on holiday. I had stayed in Lymington for a few nights - in another hotel - but had visited Stanwell House on all three evenings for pre and post dinner drinks. I used to come to Stanwell House all the time before it closed for a refurb as it was always friendly, good food, good acclimation and very dog friendly.\nIt was lovely to visit the new refurbished Hotel and I have to say it is beautifully done! The bar which my initial visits took me too is really nicely done out. A full range of drinks including cocktails etc and a nice relaxed atmosphere both at the start of the evening and end.\nWhen my plans changed and I needed somewhere to stay for the night I immediately tried Stanwell House. The receptionist couldn\u2019t have been more helpful and got me booked in quickly. I was quite late arriving as had to make my way back from the Isle of Wight and it was dark when I arrived. This on top of me being a bit flustered meant I couldn\u2019t find the car park that she had explained to me. I called her from the car and she guided me in. She couldn\u2019t have been nicer telling me not to worry and that she\u2019d be waiting for me as would a stiff drink if it was needed - which it was!!!!!\nI had my dog with me - so dog bed and suitcase in tow - the car park is the other side of the road to the hotel. Super easy once you get to it. The receptionist (sorry should have got her name) greeted me and quickly checked me in, took my case to my room and was just so sweet to me as I was having a stressful time!!!!\nThe room was beautiful and as soon as I got in there all my worries drifted away!!! Beautiful decor and the bed was so comfy!!!! Dog treats were also supplied as well as a bowl and I think there would have been a bed if I hadn\u2019t brought my dogs own one with us. \nAfter a quick freshen up I headed back to get something to eat. Sadly I was too late and the kitchen was closed. The receptionist was very apologetic but no one\u2019s fault as I had arrived very late in the day. I headed to a local place to eat and came back for a nightcap in the bar. It\u2019s just a nice place to sit and relax.\nI slept really well and the bed was just lovely. The tea tray had some lovely treats too and a nice cuppa in bed in the morning was great!\nBreakfast for me was in the orangery as I had the dog with me, which is fine, I don\u2019t expect to be in a main restaurant with a dog. The orangery is lovely anyway. Lovely selection for breakfast, cooked, continental and even fish with a buffet spread of fruits, cheeses, meats. \nAll in all I had a wonderful stay. My plans had changed and I found myself in quite a stressful situation but once in Stanwell House all of that disappeared. Can\u2019t wait to come back and enjoy again but with the addition of an evening meal as the menu sounds delicious.\nSpecial thanks to the receptionist who really did make all the difference, a very kind lady.\nHighly recommend visiting and staying here.",

The decor in the restaurant is lovely, but the table was a little high for myself sat on the booth. \n\nWe ordered three of the nibbles and shared them between us as a starter. The fried Samphire was delicious along with the lemon aioli. The humus and bread was nice, but the bread was very crunchy.\n\nAll of us enjoyed our main courses, the salmon in the sandwiches ordered was very generous. The steak was out of this world and the chicken burger was delicious too.\n\nThe pudding was nice too, the Panna Cotta was fresh and zingy. The treacle tart was nice, but needed a bit more refinement.\n\nThe staff were charming and the atmosphere was lovely. We will definitely visit again.",

    "review_text": "=== Sleepless in Stanwell House ===\nWe've just returned from a two night stay at Stanwell House. We would not return due to significant issues with noise from the running of the hotel.\n\nPositives - room was nicely decorated, with a comfortable bed and good quality linens. Hot and efficient shower. Standard of cleanliness in our room was very good. We ate at the Samphire restaurant for dinner on the first night and the food was good, as was the standard of service. Overall we found the staff team to be friendly and helpful. \n\nThe Big Problem - Noise. We stayed in Room 26 (suite with balcony) and it very quickly became apparent that there was a significant noise issue caused by being directly above the kitchen. From approx 17:00 to 23:00 we could hear crashing of pans, extractor fans, glass washing equipment and a generally very high level of noise, directly underneath the bedroom. Some of the crashes and bangs were so loud that they made the room physically shake, and it was unrelenting. At approx 22:30 on the first night we called down to reception and asked when the noise would stop, expressed our concern and requested a call from the manager the following day. After a brief overnight interlude, the noise started again the nexr morning at 6:30am, waking us both. When we spoke to manager Lance, he suggested that the issue was that we are light sleepers - we are not, and one of us was wearing earplugs and still woke! We were offered a room move, however this was to the room of another couple who were being moved due to another noise issue from a neighbouring premises. Fortunately we had heard them discussing it at breakfast so declined. After negotiations, Lance eventually agreed to deduct \u00a370 per night from the room rate having initially offered to deduct \u00a340 per night. Considering we had paid over \u00a3300 per night this didn't feel particularly fair but by this time we were too weary to challenge any further. The following evening we were out but we were again woken at 6:30am on the second morning. The adjoining room also had an extremely loud extractor fan in the bathroom against bedroom wall which added to the sleep issues. I cannot accurately express how loud the kitchen was, and we are both city dwellers used to traffic noise etc. Just to be clear, this isn't at all a criticism of the hard working kitchen team, but about the layout and lack of insulation/understanding of how noise can travel. For a luxury boutique hotel, this place has some serious work to do on delivering a truly luxurious experience, which is a shame when the rooms and restaurant are really pleasant. We would strongly suggest that a member of hotel staff spends 24 hours staying in Room 26, to gain a full understanding of the extent of the kitchen noise.",

    "review_text": "=== Great base for 4-night New Forest stay ===\nSituated on the High Street, the hotel is a short walk from Lymington Town train station and the Quay. Lots of care has been taken over the decor and the staff were very professional. Our room was at the top of the house. Worth noting there are quite a few stairs to get there so those rooms may not suit everyone. The room (and en-suite bathroom) were nicely presented. No fridge in the room but you can choose to have milk delivered daily. The room was uncomfortably warm on the first night but the receptionist was quick to provide a fan the next day that made things much better. We had dinner in the Samphire restaurant. Three courses with wine made it a little on the pricey side but the food was good. We didn\u2019t make use of the Orangery or Bar ourselves but these looked like great spaces that were popular throughout our stay.  We\u2019d definitely consider a return visit in future.",

Our window overlooked a huge awning which completely blocked the view of the garden. The bed was a double but definitely not king size. We complained at the time and was advised by the general manager that the issue of the view would be addressed when we checked out. We hadn\u2019t slept in the bed at that point. The matter was ignored when we checked out probably as we had already paid in full prior to arriving. I emailed twice regarding the issues before I received a response which denied we had a garden view stating it did overlook the garden and said they do not have smaller beds so ours was a king size which made no sense at all. Our bed definitely was not 6\u2019 wide which a king size bed should be. Customer satisfaction clearly is not important to the management and their website is definitely misleading",

We had specified a ground floor room with a walk in shower for my husband who has walking problems but on arrival found the room had an over bath shower.  We had planned to have next door rooms with my husbands brother as both rooms opened onto a courtyard.  We ended up having to have a first floor to get the walk in shower.  No towels in the room and the window only opened about 6inches.  There was air con but we could not find out how to work it.    The food was a disappointment too, expensive in the Samphire restaurant and although we were sat in the Orangery we were told we all (4 of us) had to order from the same menu i.e. if one person chose from the Samphire menu then we all had to.  The food was not, I feel, as good as the description or the price.   The bacon as part of the English breakfast was incinerated on both mornings and we had to send the toast back to get it toasted, instead of just limp.   The car park is close (250m) on the other side of the road but no porterage so I had to carry luggage myself.",

But it took a long time for our main course to be cleared and so our dessert didn't arrive until 1415.  We asked for the bill as soon as we ordered dessert but whilst paying a duty manager interrupted our waitress in the middle of taking payment and would have delayed matters if I hadn't been quite blunt.  \nThere are a lot of steps in the hotel and not all of them have handrails to hold onto - we all had disabilities of one form or another.

Belly of pork v poor.\nBest part was side dish chips.\nWe complained and spoke to restraunt manager.\nHer offer was to remove service charge from Bill. We pointed out she was punishing the staff for quality of food. Her response they like to get feed back and kitchen staff would also suffer.\nWhat a way to treat your staff when they were no culpable.\nRestraunt manager was most unimpressive impressive.\nThere was an extremely noisy table behind us and we could hardly hear ourselves.\nAll in all  a very dissapointing visit to a beautifully refurbished hotel.\nWill not be rushing back.",

The staff were very welcoming and helpful. We were tempted by the tasting menu but eventually decide to eat from the \u00e0 la carte. Excellent red shrimp risotto to start and I thoroughly enjoyed the gurnard (delicious sauce), with a side of some of the best chips I've had! My friend's asparagus starter and half-lobster were equally good. A good wine list, with the wines well-kept. A lovely evening and we shall return when next staying in the area.",

Confused as to what had I actually just experienced. \n\nLooking at the surroundings, I don\u2019t think this hotel knows what it is. Is it a pub? A bar? A bistro? An afternoon tea hall? A fine dining restaurant? The answer is it\u2019s trying to be all of these things but not quite pulling off any of them. \n\nThe food was disappointing. A seafood platter that was not presented well (it was all plonked on the plate), where everything was creamy or full of mayo. Good fish does not need creamy sauces. A very over cooked turbot with chewy pancetta with two carrots placed next to it, red mullet that was served with a quite pleasant salty coquette but a very sweet sauce. All served lukewarm and in small portions. The service was SLOW. Our server was very pleasant but she was the only one who showed any interest and was left to manage the room by herself. Most people in the restaurant looked as disappointed as we felt. \n\nMay I suggest you move the afternoon teas into the lovely Samphire room, keep the food for the Salt bar only and use the rest of the space for cocktails. I think then this place could stop all the confusion and the flow would benefit all.",

We stayed mid-week for 1 night in an upstairs, comfortable, quiet, newly furnished room overlooking the garden and terrace. The hotel has undergone a high quality comprehensive renovation and upgrade including IT systems yet maintained its classic character and charm. Just the conference room and terraced garden are in the final stages of completion. Many of the original staff like Emily in reception have returned and were enthusiastic about the changes. The central glass roofed central atrium was clearly popular as a place to meet and socialize throughout the day. With soft lighting, the airy dining room has glass doors that open on to the garden terrace. Given a choice, this area would be our preferred area to sit. During our stay, the dining staff were always attentive and courteous, but Samantha deserves a special mention. The menu was both interesting and tempting such that our 3 course meal which included scallops, venison, chicken and a shared dessert did not disappoint. The food was delicious, attractively plated, discreetly served and complemented by a glass or two of Sangiovese. We look forward to our next visit.",

Service a little slow but they were busy so it was fine. The only negative thing I would say is that the parking was tricky - people not finding sufficient spaces and lots of shunting about as some customers double parked behind main row making it difficult for leaving customers to manoeuvre out and customers trying to come in then blocked the exit. I wonder if all the cars were actually customers or people using it as a free car park?",

But today's visit has really not impressed me.\n\nI walked in and found a table, to be fair I was served quickly and the interactions were friendly. Menu, especially the specials, sounded great, but the sizzling steak appealed.\n\nThe food is where it went wrong, nothing inherently inedible but, when a meal is \u00a324 with steak and scallops you are looking forward to a feast. I got a 4oz steak (as advertised so not commenting there) but when the 4oz steak is sliced into 3 pieces and every single piece is 50% fat I got a 2oz steak.\n\nScallops were cooked well......because I cooked them!\n\nThe mushrooms were basically oil (though flavourful) and the sweet potato fries were the worst I have ever had, just mush. Absolutely felt like they were boiled not fried. \n\nThe whole meal was served with 3 sauces that didn't compliment the scallops at all, at a push a couple could have gone with the steak.\n\nAnd then as I was sitting by the bar I had to listen to the bar staff talk about their visit to a strip club and cafe parfait.\nAll in all, not a place I will revisit for food ( I am local)",

I understand it was Easter Sunday but our table seemed to be getting different service to others around. No table service but others were getting it, main food came out VERY quick after starters.. I\u2019m talking less than 5 minutes- all hot and fresh but not ideal. A goats cheese salad was ordered that came missing the beans, no coleslaw for the two burgers ordered. We didn\u2019t get checked back on to bring these issues up and no staff available to pull aside, maybe break time?? We had to keep asking for cutlery also.

It is a fantastic location and all the staff we encountered were first class especially Jane at Breakfast times who went out of her way to look after everyone's needs (A true asset)  There was also one of the waiting staff who's name I did not take down (She had a butterfly tattoo on her upper arm) who seemed to be everywhere when something was required again an asset to the team at Balmer Lawn. \nWe were very well looked after.\nThe room we stayed in was great for 2 nights we stayed, however the 3rd night we had some neighbours who were quite loud this was made worse because we were in a room with connecting doors (understanding for larger families but sound proofing an issue) \nThe room was impeccably cleaned and refreshed every day.\nThe food and drink were of a very high standard at all times.\n\nUnfortunatley for us the spa was being renovated at the time of our stay but the treatments continued in other rooms and again were just amazing",

We found the hotel advertised on the New Forest tourism website. When I called the hotel to make a reservation, they denied any knowledge of the advertisement on the website. It was a very unpleasant experience. It was also quite ludicrous in a way - to be a customer trying to make a booking and having to spend so much time explaining their own advertising. I had printed a 'voucher' (no monetary value) on the website and called the hotel to make the booking, referring to the offer advertised on the website. Reception said they would call back but did not do so. The following day, there was still no response. After much going back and forth (quite incredible really how difficult it was to take a booking),  I was finally offered a room and agreed the price and 30 seconds after agreeing the booking, I was told there were no more standard rooms. I would have given 1 star were it not for the apology call from the General Manager.  We were so messed about by the hotel that we ended up not going away for the weekend, which was hugely disappointing. I've been offered a tea 'subject to availability' in the next 12 months. I'm not sure that I would take up the offer as it doesn't address the problem I had.",

There is also a lift which is very handy for getting luggage to and from your room.\nThe restaurant offers a good buffet breakfast and dinner. \nMy initial thoughts on the dinner menu was that it was expensive but the quality of the food was superb . We were there for three nights and enjoyed the most amazing food on each night. There is also a good selection of vegan and vegetarian food . They were also very thorough on food allergy requirements.\nAs dog lovers we were also pleased to see that there were a number of well behaved visiting dogs.

For the past few years, we've camped at the camping site next door, and I always walked past the Balmer Lawn and wondered what it would be like to stay there. My expectations were high, and I am pleased to say that the hotel didn't disappoint. \n\nWe stayed in room 14, which is a first-floor room, at the front of the hotel overlooking the cricket pitch. Best of all,  it has a balcony. The view from the balcony was a little obscured by the marquee above The Lodge, but we quite liked the fact that this gave us some privacy on the balcony. The room was spacious, comfy, and well equipped with a huge superking bed. We had a slight problem with the (complimentary!)  safe in the wardrobe, but within 5 minutes of phoning down to reception, someone came to our room and reset it for us. \n\nWe loved the room and its location, but I knew we would. Leisure time is too important to me to waste if I don't like a room, so I used the hotel's on line 'look before you book' feature on their website (a great feature!) and booked direct.\n\n I knew from reading previous reviews that the staff were very professional at this hotel, and again, I wasn't let down. Everyone we met from receptionists to bar/restaurant staff to housekeeping were polite, efficient, and friendly. The hotel seems to attract a great clientelle too, we met some great people and although we don't have a dog ourselves, we loved that the hotel is 'dog friendly'. \n\nBreakfast each day was a highlight. The buffet had a great selection of hot and cold food, and you could tell that the ingredients were top-notch! The staff at breakfast were exactly the right mix of being attentive without being intrusive. \n\nWhen I'm travelling for pleasure as opposed to business, I appreciate a hotel that's full of character and  personality and feels like a bit of a treat. That's exactly what we got at the Balmer Lawn hotel. My only complaint is that this break has completely spoilt me for camping. When I next return to Brockenhurst, I'll be sleeping in the comfort of this hotel - not in a tent!",

We were greeted by a lovely friendly receptionist and quickly checked in.  Our room was lovely with a view over the lawns of the hotel with New Forest ponies roaming around.  We ate in the Beresford restaurant twice and the food was exceptional, though quite pricey.  The waiters were professional, efficient and friendly as were the bar staff.\nOne thing to note, our room was on the first floor above the reception area and was a little noisy when guests were arriving - worth asking for a higher floor or a room at the back of the hotel.  But that did not spoil our stay and we will definitely be returning.",

    "review_text": "=== Excellent service and good food ===\nAfter spending some time considering the various hotels in the Brockenhurst area, we chose the Balmer Lawn for our 3-night break and are so pleased that we did.  We received a warm, friendly and efficient welcome and were very pleased with our room which was on the second floor and had a large balcony overlooking the cricket pitch on the famous Balmer Lawn and the forest beyond where we regularly watched wild ponies and cattle passing by. Part of the reason for choosing the Balmer Lawn was for its 2 AA rosette restaurant, Beresford\u2019s, as good food is an important part of any hotel stay for us.  Once again, we were not disappointed as the food was consistently delicious and well-presented befitting its 2 rosettes, and the service we received was truly excellent.  While the d\u00e9cor in the public areas could be considered slight quirky, the bar/lounge and restaurant areas all enjoy a relaxed and comfortable atmosphere thanks in the main part to the wonderful staff. Every single member of staff that we encountered was very friendly, kind, caring and cheerful while remaining appropriately professional.  All the staff appeared to really enjoy being there and nothing was too much trouble for any of them. We would like to particularly mention and thank Chloe from the restaurant team, who looked after us so well for a number of our meals during our stay. We would have no hesitation in recommending this hotel if you enjoy good food and excellent service.",

It was tired and small.  The phone didn\u2019t work.  Nothing superior about it. The bed wasn\u2019t very comfortable.  \n\nI regularly stay in good quality hotels and expect as a minimum an iron and ironing board. Bathrobe and slippers particularly if a spa hotel.  Toiletries including body lotion, not just unbranded shower gel and shampoo/conditioner which didn\u2019t smell superior.\n\nI could not fault the staff who were all welcoming and helpful.  \n\nWhen I spoke to the manager to say that I was extremely disappointed with the room he explained that they were full but could move us the following day, which they did and Room 31 was what I would have expected for the rate, but again no robes or ironing board and had to request this from reception. \n\nThe restaurant was good and food that we had was tasty.\n\nBreakfast ok but staff need to ensure they are monitoring the food so guests don\u2019t have to ask when items run out.  A coffee machine which offers a selection of coffee without extra charge would have been good.\n\nA pleasant stay after the initial disappointment but if you are stating 4* then the little additional touches make all the difference to the customer experience and unfortunately they were lacking. \n\nThe new forest is beautiful and the location of the hotel was good.",

As someone suffering from Coeliac disease, I travel with my own food to ensure no health issues.  However, we were recommended the Albero Italian restaurant and I cannot praise them enough.  Firstly the staff were friendly and attentive without being intrusive and the food prices are reasonable for the quality of food.  The gluten free pasta is EXCEPTIONAL.  Home made and absolutely delicious.  My ceoilac condition was taken seriously but not highlighted as \"a problem\".  I was not made to feel like the \"awkward diner\" and could enjoy most of the same food as my family could without making huge changes.  The other two members of our party also thoroughly enjoyed their (non GF) pizza and pasta meals.  Nothing was too much bother and the food was delicious.  Thank you Albero team.

The bed was so hard and uncomfortable we couldn\u2019t sleep, the pillows was next to useless.The bathroom was tiny when sat on the loo your arm was resting on the sink nowhere else to put it. The shower was working but when in its holder only pointed to the taps would not reposition. In the morning we went to reception and passed on our comments. We told them we would be cutting short our stay. The receptionist was very quick to offer another room and an upgrade which we accepted. On arrival to our new room we was surprised at how different the rooms were. The view was overlooking a cricket field with horses roaming freely instead of to plastic sheep. The bed was comfortable the quilt was a much better quality, the room was a better size, roomy and not claustrophobic and the shower worked perfectly. We felt this room should have been the price of the first room. The first room was definitely not worth \u00a3200+ per night. The rooms are starting to look dated it\u2019s a shame really.

Visiting one of the incredible wedding showcases and seeing the space set up as a beautiful wedding setting and being able to meet and speak to all the recommended suppliers made us even more secure in this decision.\nWe booked the Everything But The Dress package and were incredibly surprised at the value, convenience how much we could personalize the package to make the wedding of our dreams. We came across no other venues offering such a package, and cannot recommend it enough.\nMeetings and communication with Ruth and the weddings team was so easy, with us feeling genuinely cared for and listened to every step along the way. We loved being able to meet up at the hotel to chat through plans and decisions, and also being able to visit on showcase days where we knew all our suppliers would be in one place. This made planning so easy, and took so much of the stress out of the wedding preparation process.\nWhen our big day came around, from the moment myself and my bridal party arrived at the hotel the day before we were treated with so much care and made to feel so at ease. We were able to set things up in the wedding space, and start to see everything coming together. We then had dinner in The Lodge which was second to none \u2013 special thanks to our waiter Hilton who went above and beyond to cater for one of my bridesmaids dietary requirements, and sourced me a sausage to burry to give us good luck with the weather (which turned out perfect!). Also special thanks to Kiaran behind the bar who made us all the most incredible espresso martini shots, which even now people are taking about how good they were!\nOur wedding day itself was perfect in every way, even down to the rain stopping just as the bridal party were just about to walk down the aisle. The pavilion and Beaulieu Room were both stunning, and our guests loved the garden games set up to play with throughout the day. The food and the service from the banqueting team with it were outstanding, and we had so many comments about the amazing quality of all of the food served. Special thanks to Briony and Sam who waited on us and the top table \u2013 they both made us feel so special.\nWe cannot recommend Balmer Lawn, and the EBTD package enough. All the people we worked with, be this at the hotel or the suppliers we have through the package were beyond compare, and all helped us bring our dream wedding to life. Thank you again to anyone and everyone who was involved with The Barton Wedding \u2013 you are all superstars. We\u2019re so sad it\u2019s all over now, but we cannot wait to see our stunning photos, and come back next year to celebrate our 1st anniversary!\nAnn-Marie & Mike Barton",

Jane and the breakfast team always had our table ready (with a chair already taken away, to accommodate the wheelchair) and were always so thoughtful.\nThere was a slight blip with the lift, but again, the staff worked it out to enable dad to get up/down. \nThey took on board our feedback about smoother ramps for wheelchair access and we really can't thank them enough for a special weekend, to celebrate an 80th birthday!",

The grounds were gorgeous and perfectly kept (with lots of horse sightings - exciting for a New Yorker like me!), the rooms were perfectly decorated and comfortable, and the food was incredible. Probably the best hotel breakfast I've ever had. We dined at the restaurant for tea time (also a huge highlight! Left absolutely stuffed!) and for dinner, and found the meals to be fabulous. Big shout out to the staff, everyone was so kind and helpful. Would love to visit again!",

Don't read any negative reviews we had a really lovely stay! The hotel decor and location is beautiful. Staff are so friendly. The food was 10/10 including breakfast the scrambled egg was amazing! Just like we make it at home proper scrambled egg! We had steaks the night before and these were lovely! Fan already in the room which is a bonus for us and staff arranged an iron for us to borrow. The bed was comfortable and my daughter was extremely happy with her bunk bed! We used the indoor pool which was nice! Only regret is we did this as part of a trip so only had one night so didn't feel like we got to see the hotel as much as we could! The ponies at side of the hotel were a bonus!",

You quite literally have wildlife directly in front of the hotel like horses and we even had a herd of cows march through! The location and building is absolutely perfect. \n\nWe checked in and the highlight of the visit was the staff, they were polite, helpful and clearly wanted to be there and made such a great atmosphere. \n\nWe had dinner in the restaurant, it was a little bit expensive but we were expecting it as it is an award winning restaurant. The food was well worth the price, it came out looking delicious and the taste was perfect. The dining experience really was a 10/10. \n\nThe bar in the evening is also a fantastic venue, lovely, quiet and the drink choice is very good, rare to see a hotel with a pale ale on tap. Again, staff were attentive and couldn\u2019t have done more for us. \n\nWe did change rooms which was absolutely no hassle after a slight issue. We asked for a move and it was done with no hassle, no fuss and just an easy process and we are grateful for that. \n\nWe did have an issue which we did raise when we left via email and Tom the Ops manager called us a few days later and was brilliant and clearly cared about us, if they wanted to the hotel could\u2019ve just brushed it off but they wanted to make it right and did so. \n\nFantastic hotel, lovely venue, great food and drinks, brilliant location and the highlight were the team working there. We very much look forward to returning.",

Whilst eating the heavens opened with rain and we decided not to go back to the campsite, but instead to stay the night as a room was available.\nWe have 2 electric bikes which were locked on to our van bike rack, but were very concerned regarding possible theft, as the lady at the campsite had told us that it was very common in that area and locks weren\u2019t a deterrent.\nThe hotel has secure locking for bikes and Tom the operations manager was happy for us to store them there, which was a relief.\nOverall I found the staff very customer focussed and helpful, which to us is the number one important thing with the hospitality industry. Yes service once might have been a bit slow, but because the staff were so charming not an issue.\nWe ended up staying at the hotel 3 nights as we liked it so much, with good spa amenities, both indoor and outdoor pool. Food was also very good, plus location on the edge of the New Forest, with trails from the hotel. Will definitely be going back some day.\n\nSimon & Jane alias the soggy campers.",

    "review_text": "=== Avoid this place like the plague. ===\nHaving stayed at the Balmer Lawn on and off for the last 25+ years, we were looking forward to another stay here, especially as the photographs on the website showed that the outside space had now become more of a drinking and eating area, no doubt an expansion on what happened during the pandemic.\n\nWe booked 2 rooms, 1 a standard room, another one of their superior rooms.\n\nUpon arrival, we were asked to pay in full for both rooms \u2013 that always strikes me as a bit odd \u2013 do they think we would run off, or worse, leave if the rooms were not as expected?  Anyway, duly paid, we went to our rooms.  First, the standard room.  Room 1, on the first floor, just outside the lift, was very small, the view was of a brick wall, and the room was incredibly hot \u2013 and this was not even a particularly hot day.  The giant fan did little to help.\n\nThe superior room was not very superior.  Room 25, located on the 2nd floor, at the back of the hotel, overlooks the roof of the spa, and a view to a bit of the outdoor pool.  The room is very tired and does not live up to the description or photographs on the website.  Stained carpet, worn headboard where guests\u2019 heads have rubbed there over the years (yuk!), cheap Ikea furniture with bubbling veneer, filthy window frames, a useless shower of a small bath, the bathroom shelf over the toilet (watch out in case anything falls off the shelf), terrible scratchy old towels, uncomfortable beds.\n\nThere has been a change to the carpets in the hotel, drab grey makes the whole place look corporate and cheap.  \n\nWe ordered a bottle of champagne \u2013 at \u00a3155 a bottle, they didn\u2019t even have in refrigerated.  No thanks.\n\nWe had dinner in the main restaurants on both nights \u2013 looking forward to it with their much hyped 2 AA rosettes.  Another mistake.  A poor bistro type menu, no nods to anything remotely fine dining.  Overcooked steaks, undercooked lamb, miserable portions, under seasoned\u2026 Awful.  Breakfast is another disaster.  A bunfight with a buffet for cooked items.  Greasy bacon, and those scrambled eggs \u2013 like powdered, insipid dust, hardly yellow in colour.  Probably the very worst scrambled eggs in the UK.  A note to the chef here \u2013 have you no shame?  In fact, to the hotel owners and managers \u2013 try staying here yourselves with a view to being a guest.  \n\nThe spa has an indoor and outdoor pool.  Both heated (by a candle judging by the chilliness of the water in both) and the jacuzzi was out of action.  Again, horrible tatty towels to use.\n\nThis 4-star hotel used to be quite good, and the restaurant used to be very good.  But now it\u2019s just another flea-bitten hole, trading on past glories, with tired staff, tired rooms and tired facilities.  Avoid this place like the plague.",

I hadn\u2019t made a booking and asked if they had a table. The waitress went to check with the manager and then told me I could sit on a table for four but i would have to leave in just over an hour as they needed the table back. I was a bit disconcerted but agreed as I assumed they had decided they could accommodate me. I made the effort to choose my dishes quickly, and after a few minutes the manager came over to take my order. I started speaking and asked for my starter then said \u201cand for main\u201d, then was interrupted mid sentence by the manager saying \u201cno. You can\u2019t have a starter and a main. I can bring everything together if you want but I can\u2019t do a starter and a main for you as we need you to leave by quarter to seven\u201d. I said \u201cOk, don\u2019t worry about it then, I will go somewhere else\u201d and she replied \u201cwell it is Saturday night, its a busy night\u201d. I responded, \u201cI know, but if you don\u2019t have a table then just tell me you don\u2019t have a table\u201d. I then left and easily found another great restaurant who had space for me. \n\nI was really disappointed that in the interests of money grabbing another customer the wait staff would behave this way. The menu looked great but wasn\u2019t cheap - my starter was \u00a310.50 and my main \u00a320. I don\u2019t expect to sit down to a meal in a nice restaurant and be treated like i am taking someone else\u2019s spot and need to hurry up and leave, nor indeed that i would be interrupted mid sentence and told that I could not have my meal the normal way. I come to eat out on my own to relax. \n\nThe New Forest is full of fabulous restaurants. I visit a nearby equestrian venue every year, and I now will never return to Albero Italian after this experience. There is no need when I can easily find another great restaurant where the staff have a better attitude towards their customers. I would have had no problem if I had been told that unfortunately they were fully booked, and might have tried again next time. Now, certainly not. It is never a good idea to make one customer feel like less than another.",

This is an establishment that takes pride in the overall experience - food, service and setting. Warm congratulations to the whole team and special thanks to chef for our distinctive main course and the multidimensional fig salad, so good it will be a main course next time, not just a starter.

On arrival there were about 5 people standing around the bar, none of them seeming particularly interested in serving/speaking to us. I advised we had a booking, a chap disappeared came back and without really directing his conversation to us mentioned a table number.  As another couple of people had entered the bar I was unsure whether he was speaking to us or them, either way he did not show us (or them) to a table.  We therefore decided to go to the table and as it was empty sat down.  We waited for someone to come and at least take a drinks order, but nothing. After around 5/10 mins we went to the bar to get a drink and was advised to place our food order at the bar. I was surprised about this as I had heard a bar person/waitress take a dessert order from another table.  Nonetheless we sat back down and looked at the menu.  Another couple arrived a few mins later and were directed to a table and told it was table service.  I checked with the couple as this was contrary to what we had been told.  They were definite they had been told table service.  I queued for a bit to try and query why we were not given table service but others around us were, but by this time the place was getting busy and there were several people ahead of me.  As I'd already spent half an hour getting more and more frustrated we decided to leave.  I therefore cannot comment on the standard of the food but the standard of the customer service was extremely poor.",

We couldn\u2019t see any grass never mind a cricket pitch. We know what time the occupant upstairs went to bed, that they got up twice in the night and rose at 6.45 on Saturday morning for a shower. We did not hear footsteps only very squeaky floorboards right above our bed. A floor tile in the bathroom, in front of the sink was broken in two and thankfully due to my quick reaction I averted what could have been a very serious cut to my foot. We covered the tile immediately with the bath mat to avoid an accident. There were no tissues no cotton wool or similar toiletries and no shaving mirror. The plug device in the sink was not working.

    "review_text": "=== Rather dated and not as described ===\nI booked the Balmer Lawn Hotel last minute as a treat for my grandson. Having visited several hotels in the area, I chose this one because it was described as having individually styled and contemporary rooms, and it also has an outdoor pool. Additionally, it is close to Beaulieu, which I wanted to visit.\n\nUpon arrival, I was informed that the outdoor pool was closed due to issues. This was disappointing, as it was the main reason for my booking. However, reception assured me they were working on it and would keep me informed.\n\nOur initial impressions of the lobby and downstairs dining area were that the building has potential, but the decor is rather cheap-looking, reminiscent of 'The Range' or 'Dunelm.' This might be acceptable elsewhere but not for a hotel that advertises itself as a 4-star 'LUXURY ESTABLISHMENT.' A cohesive update would be beneficial.\n\nTo reach our room on the third floor, we took the lift, which was not a good first impression. The lift door was covered in rust and needed a deep clean. After dropping off our bags, we opted to use the stairs, which were much more pleasant.\n\nI had booked a superior room and was given number 54. While the room was fairly large, it was very dated and drab. Striped dark wallpaper and worn laminate bedside tables did not scream luxury. The black plastic headboard, drab dark striped carpet, and cheap-looking curtains were not welcoming. The radiator covers were also rusted. The bathroom was clean with fairly contemporary tiles, but the fixtures were worn, with the chrome finishing worn away. Additionally, the sink was not properly attached to the stand and was coming away.\n\nThe twin beds were hard and very small, causing my grandson to worry about falling off during the night. The pillows were hard and past their prime, and the towels were thin, not indicative of a 4-star establishment.\n\nOn the plus side, the outdoor seating bar area is pleasant and welcoming, overlooking the cricket pitch with New Forest ponies wandering across. Most of the staff are lovely and very helpful. The bar snacks are good, and my grandson enjoyed his mocktail.\n\nAfter returning from Beaulieu, we found the pool issue had been addressed, and it was open, so we used it for the remainder of the afternoon (approximately 1 hour from 5-6pm).\n\nDinner was good; I had the special of skate wing, which was fresh and wholesome but would have benefitted from a sauce to enhance its flavor. My grandson enjoyed his burger and fries immensely.\n\nBreakfast, however, left much to be desired. It was buffet-style, with fried eggs, bacon, mushrooms, etc., all of which were cold. I asked for poached eggs, which also arrived cold. The bread was of poor quality, akin to what you find in cheap supermarkets. The only redeeming factor was the fresh fruit salad. I asked for a cappuccino made with oat milk twice and eventually gave up, asking for it to be taken off my bill.\n\nOverall, my experience was disappointingly lukewarm. I'm glad it was my grandson and not my partner I brought here, as he is thirteen and didn\u2019t have high expectations. I, on the other hand, believe this hotel has a lot to improve and I am unsure how it has achieved a 4-star listing. My suggestion to management is to look at hotels like 'The Gallivant' or 'The George' in Rye, both of which are excellent and where I have previously stayed. For comparisons regarding spa hotels, Carys Manor down the road and the Nici in Bournemouth are worth looking at, both of which I have also stayed at.",

We stayed 3 nights in a superior room on the second floor. The room was clean and comfortable with good views across the forest area.  There was a fridge in the room which was useful plus tea and coffee making facilities. Towelling robes in wardrobe .\nThe room did seem to retain the heat despite having the windows open and there is no AC so we had to make use of the fan provided which was fine.\nWe found the bed to be comfortable. \nThe bathroom has a walk in shower which was ideal for us due to some mobility difficulties. However we did encounter problems when using the shower. First of all the water pressure is quite weak but on consideration this may be a good thing because the drain doesn't seem adequate and we ended up with quite a puddle on the bathroom floor to mop up each time we showered. Also the hot water takes a fair while to come through  and getting the right temperature is definitely a skill so patience is required .\nThere are dispensers on the wall for shower gel and shampoo plus hand soap dispenser by the sink and I must say I really liked the smell of these toiletries.  Wish I knew what the scent was so I could buy some at home.\nWe used the pool on one occasion but  its quite small so not suitable for a serious swim. Husband enjoyed using the sauna. Jacuzzi was not working.\nThere are lockers to use for personal items while using the leisure facilities.\nThere are plenty of areas where you can find a comfy chair to sit and read a book while having a cuppa. \nBreakfasts were lovely. Lots of choice so its tempting to eat more than one normally would. ( back on the diet now.) Very helpful friendly staff on hand. We didn't eat in the restaurant in the evenings as we wanted to try some of the many restaurant choices in the area.  \nWe had a bit of trouble with our keycards unfortunately.  Two afternoons running they stopped working and we were locked out of our room so had to get them reset.  Frustrating but quickly sorted by reception.\nAll in all we thoroughly enjoyed our stay at the Balmer lawn hotel . Its a lovely hotel in a great setting from which to explore the wonderful new forest area.\nWould definitely like to return sometime.",

Abit nervous of using a third party I called the hotel direct and they matched the price.\n\nWhat a great find.  \nEarly for check in so we sat outside with a drink.\n\nAll the staff (and I mean all of them) were super friendly, nothing was too much trouble, were attentive without being intrusive.  The bar staff outside (Hilton I think) was very engaging and Donnell our waiter in the dining room was very polite and efficient.\n\nWe loved the feel of the hotel, not pretentious at all. Very welcoming,  We had a superior room overlooking the lawn, it was clean and comfortable.  The spa was lovely  (no hot tub working), the gardens were really nice, lots of seating areas, even the outside pool was bearable with our British weather.\n\nThe food in the restaurant was good, well presented, I would say you would struggle if you were staying a week or so with choice.  But quality and taste excellent.\n\nAll in all a great location, good food, comfortable beds, attentive staff, value for money.  We would recommend and return.",

However, our \"superior\" room was a disappointment and did not live up to expectations. It was just dull with very uninspiring decor. It was also quite noisy as it was at the front of the hotel above the outside terrace and bar and faced the very busy through road. The bed was not the most comfortable and had really poor quality pillows which did impact sleep quality. I did raise this with staff and I hope it is taken on board. We did enjoy our stay but felt that it was overpriced. A pity as Balmer Lawn is very local to us.",

We were given a cold glass of water , the necessary toiletries and we started to relax .  \n\nSupper outside on the terrace with a couple of chilled glasses of beer and wine couldn\u2019t have been better . Then, after a great night\u2019s sleep  breakfast was equally delicious . \n\nWe will be back to stay for longer that\u2019s for sure!\n\nIt also brought back happy memories as I had visited once before in 1970 when I came over from the Isle of Wight as an excited teenager with my father , just for the day . The manager at the time was  selling his beautiful New Forest horse called horse Burnrew Perdita . I rode her in the area in front of the hotel and fell in love.  She came back with me to the IOW that day where she lived to a great age !",

I mislaid a ring while in the room and had to pull out the bedside cabinet to find it\u2026 it was super clean and recently hoovered behind the cabinet \u2026 and also under the bed ( I wouldn\u2019t normally pull furniture out but had to find my ring)! \nIf I was to give one negative comment I think the shower was quite  dated but it was still perfectly functional .Also the WIFI signal was very weak in our room (46). \nThe outdoor bar area and \u201cLodge\u201d is THE best! The furniture is clean and comfortable and there are heaters and blankets available. Again, the service was great.\nWe ate in The Lodge one night to celebrate my birthday  and the food was superb. Fish popcorn and pork belly nibbles. Followed by sea bass and mussels.

On the day of the wedding our breakfast was away from the other hotel guests and then the wedding - well it was seamless, the whole event went off without a hitch (excuse the pun) and the staff were there when needed and discreet during the speeches.  It was without doubt the best \"hotel wedding\" I have attended and we cannot sing the praises of the hotel and staff enough.  The room layout was great, affording us both room and an outside private area. I can fully understand why the hotel has won awards.  10 out of 10!",

Well, we waited for half an hour sitting outdoors in the heat without a drink, my husband went to the bar to order the beer himself only to be told that someone will come out for us, 15 min later we had a waiter so we ordered our drinks which took yet another 15 min to arrive; the place was not busy by the way only about another 4 tables of customers.\nThe pizza option were very limited too, I ordered the pepperoni pizza ; that was a disappointment too. The pepperoni were of the highly processed variety with hardly any flavour other than fat. \nWhile we were waiting to order I could not help but noticing how dirty the outside window were and all the cobwebs around the outside structure which is just where we were sitting also the outside lamps were just filthy, not what you want to be sitting among on a relaxing sunny day.\nWe still enjoyed the location of the hotel and  the walk in the forest. \nI will not visit this place again, well not for a long time at least.",

The hotel is inclusive, we are both disabled but found it easy to get about and use the facilties. There are lifts and ramps discreetly blended into the layout, without imposing on the aesthetics. The hotel is excellent for pet owners who can bring their dogs with them and enjoy the restaurant without needing to mix with other guests who may not appreciate this. Those who smoke can do so away from indoor areas and non smokers without feeling ostracised.\nThere are plenty of facilities such as gym, sauna, play area, indoor and outdoor pools as well various private dining/meeting rooms. We did not use any of the facilties as mentioned but enjoyed the delicious and reasonably priced food and drinks the restaurant offered. The weather was fantastic and we enjoyed company on the patio area in the restaurant and even on the 'Brockenhurst beach' a few yards away. If outside when it cools down there are heaters and even blankets to allow guests to continue enjoying the environment. \nThe food and drinks were excellent and we were ably looked after by Samantha in the afternoon and later Adam helped us with the menu offering advice and an excellent helpful and friendly service. \nBreakfast was a choice of continental or cooked breakfast buffet but we could have ordered off the extensive breakfast menu. \nThanks everyone at Balmer lawn, we look forward to coming back",

The hotel also has 2 swimming pools one indoors and an outside one too (although the outside pool opens end of May). There\u2019s a spa too that my wife says is really reasonably priced. But most of all for me is the friendly staff they really make you feel special and look after you so well.",

We booked a room well ahead of time and confirmed we would be bringing a dog, we were placed in a room on the top floor that even in early may was so hot in the room with windows open wasn\u2019t pleasant for the dog or us. I wanted to speak to someone on reception but by 9pm on a Saturday there was nobody around. The room we were allocated was ok however the fridge that was supplied wasn\u2019t working so any food we wanted to store for the dog wasn\u2019t possible so had to ask to store the food in the kitchen which isn\u2019t ideal. For me the charge to have a dog stay is a bit ridiculous as other hotels in Brockenhurst at least offer some treats or bed for the cost which in our room we received nothing. This is our second stay at  this hotel and not sure we would stay again which is a shame as had recommended to friends but will pass on these concerns to them with the hope they can request a room that is not at the top of the hotel especially when bringing dogs. Our last stay was on the 1st floor with the dog and was much more comfortable so would suggest anyone booking here to insist on a room as low as possible as none of the rooms have aircon or fans.",

We requested a refund and this was duly given.  The reception/manager was helpful with our complaint and said he would speak to the cleaners.

The wedding went well, the food was excellent and the breakfast the next morning was really great. The staff were excellent and a credit to the hotel. There are only a couple of comments. I would have expected there to be face cloths (flannels) in the bathroom for the amount we paid. The television reception was really bad. We only got a watchable signal on BBC1 and 2. We didn't spend long enough in the room to worry at the time. (Room 41). The other comment I would make is that the bed was a double bed, when it could have been a king size. A few extra inches or centimetres makes all the difference to a comfortable nights sleep. One thing you could consider in the future when you are doing upgrade work is to install a comfort hight toilet pan. They are much more comfortable to use when you are at retirement age and your legs and hips don't work so well.",

Poor breakfast, which seems to be a common theme recently and an extremely dismissive and rude front of house called Poppy. Reading the reviews on here this seems to happen regularly and the owners response to every post makes it very clear that the terrible attitude comes right from the top.\n\nMy major issue I am still awaiting a response on is finding soiled underwear in my bedroom. I guess you cannot guarantee the work of an individual cleaner but it was almost like they didn't believe me. I had to threaten to bring them down and place on reception. Still no apology or compensation, a response 'we will speak to the people involved' just does not not wash with me (excuse the pun).\n\nI'd advise guests to look elsewhere when visiting the forest.

They had clearly been left under the heat lamp too long. Second morning items were missed from the full breakfast and the sauces requested never appeared. This was mentioned to the waitress who did offer to provide however we were almost finished before we could get anyone's attention.\n3, The tea tray was taken away after the first night and not returned so were just left with coffee pods. My husband had to go down to reception to ask for more because the phone in the room didn't work.\n4, The face cloths were also removed after the first day and not replaced.\n5, Disappointed that there was no safe in the room either.\nWe ate in the restaurant both nights. I have to say the prices in the restaurant were very steep. \u00a324 for a baked Camembert and \u00a360 for a Spatchcock Chicken. \nI was disappointed not to see any locally produced products on the menu bearing in mind there is a farm shop and vineyard less than a mile down the road. Also the hefty service charge is a bit of a cheek, I prefer to tip based on what I think it deserves and not have this added.\nOn a plus side the beds were comfy and the views were beautiful from the bedroom.",

    "review_text": "=== Really disappointing stay. Epitomised by the response of the management ===\nI asked by husband not to write a negative review of our weekend away last weekend.\n\nHowever having read the response of the owner I am very glad he did. Every attempt has been made to discredit his very honest assessment of our stay and every opportunity was given to your on duty staff to try to address our issues and deal with them without the need to leave a negative review.\n\nTo confirm we stayed in January 23 and had a lovely time, we left a positive review.\n\nWe then came in January 24 and had a disappointing roast dinner. You have tried to imply this was the same trip and that our second review contradicts the first. They clearly were not.\n\nOur disappointing experience evening meal you are correct, we should have flagged up at the time. Again my husband wanted to then and there but I told him not to. The waitress should have recognised she was taking away a plate of fat and asked if everything was ok. We did then report this to you Saturday at 10am, by Sunday 11am we had heard nothing.\n\nThe breakfast was our main issue and again you have accidentally or deliberately confused our complaint. It was not a case of plating up food, there was no fresh meats, no fresh cheese, no fruit salad, no pan au chocolate and no apple juice or orange juice.\nMy husband specifically asked if it would be topped up and was told it would be. Only one of the fruit juices was topped up before we left the restaurant 45 minutes later.\n\nThere was no one on the front desk to escalate the complaint and reception was busy so we emailed all the details.\n\nWith reference to paying for items in a supermarket it is a weird analogy. However if a supermarket had empty aisles we wouldn't spend any money. We would also take our business somewhere that could service us properly. It a supermarket sold us an item which was unfit for consumption we could take it back and get a refund. In the case of your food it was not acceptable but you still expected us to pay full price.\n\nThe meeting my husband had at the front desk was not with a receptionist but with a member of management. Your team had 24 hours to look into our complaints but neither hadn't bothered or had dismissed them. \n\nWe had booked this stay in November at allegedly best rate but you were selling the same deal \u00a320 per night cheaper through March which rubs things in the noses of guests who had paid more. That you needed to reduce costs is no surprise after our experience.\n\nRather than being quick to jump on our genuine review and disappointment please take things on board so that future guests do not feel short changed.",

    "review_text": "=== Sadly not what it once was ===\nMakes me very sad to write this, having had so many great experiences at balmer lawn over the years. However this weekend the food, the service and front desk's response was well below our expectations.\n\nWe ate a roast in January which was considerably worse than previous visits but we put this down to bad luck. However our very pricey evening meal and then our breakfast the following morning was simply not what you would expect from a 4 star hotel.\n\nPricing has risen sharply, which you would expect from inflation but it's so important that standards are upheld. We found both main courses extremely disappointing... the lamb 'rack' especially were 3 lamb chops with more fat than meat.\n\nHowever it was the breakfast that really disappointed. The buffet was completely depleted even though the breakfast hours had still 45 minutes to run. I specifically asked if they would be topping up and they said they would but I sat for remaining 45 minutes and nothing was replenished! My cooked breakfast came out wrong and there was nobody on hand to report it to.\n\nI reported my disappointment to reception but felt really robbed of with their response. In 24 hours I'd heard nothing so when I followed up at check out I was told to pay by balance and then the manager would speak to me. In other words, we are not removing any charges for the sub par food. If it was a independant restaurant you simply wouldn't pay for what was not acceptable.\n\nI told the receptionist we would not be back, she said if we do come back she would upgrade our room! I'm afraid that is a worthless offer because I wouldn't book with them again.\n\nVery disappointed",

Unfortunately it had been rescheduled to 1500 with no reason or warning, but I imagine to make space for group bookings. Luckily my room was ready though as it had been unoccupied the night before.\n\nThe room was okay, apparently an upgrade (?), but it had no fridge, no air con or working radiator so no way of drying anything, just 2 plug in heaters that you can\u2019t put anything on, the bathroom wasn\u2019t cleaned properly, there was no milk (found this out around 6am unfortunately), TV remote or hotel info leaflet/pack so I had to make my own enquiries about breakfast. The furniture was all basic Ikea, there was peeling wallpaper, marks on the table & carpet\u2026\n\nI went to use the leisure facilities (small pool, jacuzzi & sauna) and found 2 unaccompanied children in there, bombing, splashing & shouting. One repeatedly sniggered  at my pregnant belly which made me so uncomfortable I went and sat on my bed until lunch. There were no staff in the spa area to raise this with, there was a queue at reception and I was so humiliated I didn\u2019t want to traipse round the hotel in a dressing gown to make a bigger deal out of it. I also later overheard a member of staff telling a guest that the door to the facilities should have been left open without the need for a key, so really anyone could have walked in off the street and into the changing rooms too.\n\nLunch that came with the spa day was tasty & filling. I had the chicken option, the meat was tender, the spring rolls were crispy & the fruit salad was fresh. Unfortunately the \u2018tomato & peanut salad\u2019 came with half a warm cherry tomato and 3 or 4 smashed peanuts. \n\nThe treatment itself was amazing & the therapist was wonderful, polite & professional. It was a body scrub with massage & facial. My skin felt wonderful after.\n\nDinner was excellent, I was sat immediately and the food came promptly, good portion size too. I would definitely eat at the restaurant again - note, the restaurant is just off reception, not a separate room. \n\nBreakfast was also lovely, a good variety of hot & cold food as well as juice. If you want a \u2018proper\u2019 coffee it is extra cost. \n\nCheck out was quick & easy, the reception staff are friendly.\n\nOverall I had a nice stay but considering it\u2019s a 4 star hotel unfortunately it didn\u2019t really meet expectations. .",

    "review_text": "=== Worth every one of 5 stars for the hotel, the staff, the food, the location, VFM... ===\nI don't often give 5 stars, especially for a stay at a hotel as there are so many things that can be just not quite right. However, the Balmer Lawn was one of those rare experiences where every single thing was just about perfect (well, apart from the weather on the last day!)\n\nThe hotel itself is impressive, has a bit of a thirties \"feel\" about it and is stylish, well-appointed with a lovely dining area and lounge bar. \n\nThe staff are universally fantastic - everyone was so attentive, friendly and helpful and welcoming. There's also plenty of people around, which is rare in these days where the hospitality sector are still struggling so the owners must be getting something really right!\n\nFood was great, Sunday lunch a real treat (the cheese souffle was particularly stupendous). Breakfast was either buffet (one day) or prepared to order and absolutely lovely, can't fault any part of it and so much to eat you could easily skip lunch. \n\nI had my first spa treatment and it was so relaxing, I nearly dozed off and the therapist was really professional and clearly had trained hard to deliver the perfect massage.  Pool, sauna and jacuzzi all helped with the overall relaxation and it's a nice touch that it is adults only from 11.30am to 3pm. \n\nIf I had a minor niggle, it would be that the bedroom was next to the door leading into the bedroom corridor so it could be a bit noisy with people passing to and fro, but then the view across the fields from the balcony terrace made up for it.\n\nVery highly recommended if you are going to stay and explore the New Forest.",

    "review_text": "=== A mixed experience ===\nWe stayed in early February for 2 nights. This was our fifth stay at the Balmer Lawn and we were pretty excited to be returning. However on this occasion we were left underwhelmed.\n\nFirst the good points. \nThe staff are fantastic and a huge asset to the hotel. All were very attentive and courteous.\nThe hotel itself oozes country charm. The main bar and restaurant areas are well presented, comfortable and full of character.\n\nWe did not use the spa on this occasion or have dinner in the restaurant so I cannot comment on those.\n\nLess good. And admittedly these are niggles\u2026\n\nWe stayed in room 20 which we knew would not be one of the larger rooms, but it really was basic. There was no wardrobe and we had to hang clothes on a rail fixed to the wall.  The hairdryer was so ineffective I swear my wifes hair would have dried quicker by leaning out of the window. The bed was comfortable but we have stayed in better rooms at budget hotels.\n\nBreakfast was buffet style which was different to our previous stays. And it was not good at all. When staying at a 4 star hotel I prefer to order from the table. I am no longer at school and I don\u2019t like queuing for food. Ensuring there was food at the buffet appeared to be too much of a challenge. On both mornings there were several items of food that had run out. Eggs, hash browns, black pudding and mushrooms seemed the most difficult to get right. So while half a plate of food was getting cold, the rest arrived 5 minutes later. It did not make for a good experience.\n\nOverall the positives outweighed the negatives and I was told the buffet breakfast is being scrapped and they are going back to table service, which is good to hear.\n\nI expect we will return. The location, the hotel and staff are great. But next time we\u2019ll pack a hairdryer and book a better room.",

We and our guests loved the venue and my husband and I stayed an extra night after the wedding. It was their 'Everything but the dress' wedding package which cinched our decision and we did not regret it.\n\nBefore we got to the wedding, we were forced to change dates for health reasons but the Balmer Lawn team were amazing. They were very understanding and flexible to meet our needs. Ruth Mundy, the Wedding Executive kept in touch with us throughout the journey and reduced any stress which the changes would have made.\n\nOn the day, they made sure that all of our needs were met. Ruth came up to my room a couple of hours before the ceremony to check in with me and during the wedding, her team also checked in with me a couple of times to make sure we were happy. It was a fantastic day.\n\nThe venue is beautiful with a separate wedding wing so that you and your guests are separate from other hotel guests but still have access to the facilities. They also have a gate close to the wing which gives access to the neighbouring field which is perfect for photos.\n\nDuring our extended stay the next day, the staff were friendly and the restaurant and bar staff provided a lovely touch for us. We received a few extra chocolate truffles on a plate with 'Congratulations' written in chocolate sauce. We also made use of the Spa the next day. The Spa is beautiful and the treatments were great.\n\nWith the package comes a Lifetime Upgrade for future bookings and we can't wait to stay there again. We might not wait for our anniversary to stay there again.",

From the moment we met Ruth, she instantly put us at ease, & we knew we wanted her to be a part of our special day. She is an asset to the Balmer Lawn hotel, & really does go the extra mile. This is something we will never forget from our big day! \n\nRuth & all the wedding team were incredible in the lead up to our big day, all the phone calls, meetings, answering questions & generally offering advice & support really put us at ease. We opted for the Everything but the dress package for our wedding, & this was invaluable taking all the stress out of finding suppliers, especially as we got married on New Year\u2019s Eve. It\u2019s a fantastic package with amazing suppliers who also work really hard to make sure your big day goes without a hitch! We appreciated them all reaching out to us after booking the wedding to tell us what we needed to do next, which made the process so much more enjoyable of planning a wedding. Each time we visited the hotel before the wedding we were always welcomed with open arms which really made us fall in love with the charm & magic of the Balmer Lawn Hotel. \n\nWe loved adding the gin bar addition - our guests loved this as we have vouchers as a favour for the bar! Along with the special effects (dry ice show & indoor sparklers). This made our first dance unique which we loved! \n\nThe wedding breakfast was coordinated beautifully with choices for each guests pre ordered before the big day. Table wine & champagne was also the perfect accompaniment. Our wedding evening food was the bbq, & everyone commented on how delicious this was, with a wide selection. \n\nAll the staff were incredible the weekend of the wedding making sure the bridal party were looked after, & all our families. The bridal suite was beautiful, & we got ready in a room in the hotel the morning of the wedding which was lovely to have a big space as we had a large bridesmaid party. \n\nEveryone at the venue was so kind & wanted to hear all about the big day before & after with how it went. A special thank you to Lindsey, Charlotte, Adam in addition to the lovely Ruth for everything they did on the big day! We honestly couldn\u2019t recommend the hotel anymore for a wedding & we will definitely be celebrating there for years to come! \n\nKatie & Dan 31.12.23",

Whilst reserving a table in a quiet area, I explained our circumstances and the response was warm and understanding. \nWhen we arrived, the area around the table had been cordoned off and the staff had been briefed to ensure privacy, whilst also maintaining an attentive service.\nThe emotional event proved to be fantastic and the hotel and friendly staff played a huge part in making the meeting a success.

    "review_text": "=== True experience ===\nWe booked for a three day break and arrived after a horrendous journey.  I desperately needed to use the toilet but there is no disabled toilet in reception and had to climb three steps.  Only one disabled parking space although plenty of empty spaces for electric vehicles.  When we got into our room it was cold and there was a member of staff on the hallway so asked if he could look at heating.  They didn\u2019t speak English so had to speak into his phone and it then translated into their language.  They disappeared down to reception and was then told the heating was on a timer from 5.30 until 11 in the morning and the same in the evening.  Complained at reception the following day because we were still cold and and a portable heater was supplied.  We found the whole hotel totally cold.  There were no comfortable chairs or settees in the lounge to sit on and the log fire seemed only to be lit late afternoon. The lounge was used as the restaurant if you brought dogs with you.  Tried to get a coffee and a coke after dinner but waited for well over 30 minutes.  The following night we could not get near the bar or find seats.\n\nOur bed was very comfortable. We were asked each morning before 9 if we wanted our room serviced  that day.  This was new to us as we had expected this would be done automatically but obviously not as the hair in shower when we arrived was still there when we left!  \n\nWe we decided not to stay for our third day as the weather was just awful and we couldn\u2019t find anywhere to sit.  \n\nWe checked out and management kindly refunded one days stay but the break we were so looking forward to was certainly not what we expected of a nice countryside hotel.  The menu for lunch and dinner was the same with just one variation of a special for dinner.",

The en-suite  bathroom was designed for those with mobility issues which is great of course but it is in need of a major upgrade. For example, the chrome bars to assist the aforementioned are rusty and the light pulls over the basin are thin bits of string that have clearly broken and now have no pull handles. It was warm so we wanted the windows and curtains in the bedroom left open overnight but couldn't do so as immediately outside our room was the fire escape with lights blazing, understandable of course but not great for us. There were stains on the quilt and one of our towels had a wad of sellotape stuck to it. On our last evening in the restaurant my Pork Belly, generally very nice appeared to have been overcooked with the bottom impossible to cut so inedible. I had to leave this bit and pointed this out to the waitress, very nice girl, who asked if I wanted something else. I said no as I had finished the rest of the meal at this stage and didn't need any more food. I was disappointed that no-one from the kitchen came out as it would have been obvious from what I had left that it was not good. We booked through Secret Escapes so wonder if those doing so get put in the less favourable rooms.",

Why put so many out because I am sure these must have all had to be wasted. Better to keep bringing out four or so fresh ones at a time.

I'm hoping that my comments will be taken constructively to help improve the offering. \n\nThe room we were in could have been better cleaned.  I think the Henry needs replacing we were there for 3 nights and a carpet thread about 20 cm long, as well as other bits, were with us for the duration.  The water was very hot and the shower thermostat was very difficult to work to get the right temperature. As an aside a lower water temperature would  save on energy costs.  A smoothly working thermostat would save water.\n\nThe hanging bar in the wardrobe was very high fortunately I'm 1.8 m tall so could manage this however smaller people would need to use a chair.\n\nGoing from the door to the gym entails walking on a surface near the pool's changing rooms.  So people in trainers walk over the same surface that the swimmers walk to get to the pool.  Not very hygienic. \n\nService and food in the restaurant was excellent.  \n\nWould strongly suggest that the hotel reviews its use of Brockenhurst Taxis,  They over charged me by about 25% for a trip to Lymington.  It was a fixed charge after the trip I rang up Brockenhurst TAxis and they quoted a lower price for the trip .. my only conclusion is that they add a premium for this hotel's guest.",

    "review_text": "=== Great break away ===\nStayed here for three months to celebrate my husbands birthday, stayed in a suite with a balcony. \n\nCheck in was quick and easy, the hotel is very clean and the room was immaculate. The \u2018Happy Birthday\u2019 plate with the chocolates on was a great touch.\n\nThe room had everything you would need, and the shampoo and body wash they supply smells amazing! No issues with hot water, the room was nice and warm but had a fan if needed. Balcony was a lovely size, the room we were in had the view from the balcony partially blocked by the canopy from the bar, however this proved to be a plus as you could still see out but anyone sitting in the bar could t look up at the balcony so more privacy. The room was cleaned and hoovered daily, the house keeping staff were very friendly.\n\nBreakfast was nice with English or continental and extras available to ask, only thing with it was having to sort of walk through reception with the plate of food owing to how it was laid out, but that really was no issue and out of the hotels control without ripping out walls which would ruin the charm of the place.\n\nOverall a great hotel, worth every penny and the staff were brilliant and couldn\u2019t do more to help",

    "review_text": "=== Great staff, average hotel ===\nWe came to this hotel as an alternative to our usual venue in the New Forest and won't be returning.  \n\nFirst the good points - the location is great, easy stroll into Brockenhurst and lovely surroundings.  The outside areas in summer are really nice for eating and drinking.  There's plenty of parking.  And the staff are friendly and helpful - particular shout out to the 2 Marks here - the bar manager and the hotel deputy manager respectively both of whom provide excellent service.\n\nThe rather less good points - rooms are really variable.  Avoid the rooms in the middle of the hotel overlooking the inner yard with plastic sheep - the outlook from room 23 is onto a wall a foot or so away.  These rooms are dark, small and airless with dark cheap furniture - and unacceptably hot in hot weather to the point of being not fit for purpose - don't get excited about the air-con unit on the wall because it won't work.  Choose the rooms with the outside walls reached by the main stairwell - you'll get a bit of noise but not much and your room will be much larger and more comfortable - still decorated in a rather dull and depressing way - but bearable.   \n\nThe commnal areas are similarly dark and old fashioned.  In winter there will be a shortage of areas to sit as most of the inside is laid out with tables for dining with only one sofa and a couple of easy chairs around the place. There's no light space where you can sit and read and relax for instance.\n\nThe outdoor pool area needs a bit of tlc but overall it's okay - the fresh water on tap is very welcome.  The indoor pool is fine but very shallow with the only area you can easily swim properly being along one edge - it was maybe designed with children in mind.  The jacuzzi is nice.  The indoor pool is not an area suitable for simply relaxing in winter.  \n\nThe gym is tiny so hope you're the only person in there.  It is however the only place in the hotel with air-conditioning so you might want to spend a long time in there in a heatwave.  \n\nThe food was variable.  The Old Spot pork chop was tough to the point of being barely edible.    The sharing dish of lamb shoulder was nice - the lamb cooked beautifully.  The pollock dish was fine.  Breakfast was good but nothing special- the usual standard buffet, no smoked salmon, no bread other than sliced white and brown - but it was all fine. \n\nFor the price paid - which was around \u00a3300 per night, there are far better places in the vicinity.",

Unlike\nother similar hotels in Hampshire this hotel has been taken care of! Everything is refurbed, clean and tidy whilst also keeping its heritage intact. The lodge bar is beautiful with great views and incredible staff. We did not come across anyone who didn\u2019t go over and above. They were all so helpful and attentive. Not gunna lie, the hotel is expensive and some things did surprise us like limited danishes at breakfast( they stop baking them so if you go for breakfast at 9:30 you only get what is left)  and only filtered coffee included in the price of breakfast , . We asked for ice and were told they didn\u2019t have much so couldn\u2019t give us a lot. The heat in the rooms was mental. We stayed in a standard and now I understand it was heatwave but with the constant excuse from the team that it was only \u20183 a weeks a year\u2019 it was just frustrating they really were just like \u2018deal\n with it\u2019. At \u00a3240 a night I\u2019m not sure that\u2019s the approach to take . \nEverything else was perfect. We are picky, and I would stay here again.

They were on point. Thank you.\n\nI would like to give a special mention & thank you to Ron on nightshift, he is an absolute diamond, he heard me pass comment saying how i love a cup of tea now at this point of the night, it had been a long day & night, the next min there he was with a cup of tea, I didn't even know he'd heard, so thank you Ron I could have kissed you for that \ud83d\ude01\n\nBreakfast was plentiful with lots of choices, the only thing I gave a miss was the bacon as it wasn't unsmoked. \nYou had the option to have poached eggs or porridge done freshly by the chef. \nYou couldn't fault the breakfast at all it was lovely and you had continental option too, you definitely are not limited for choice, you are spoilt for choice. \n\nWe ordered food on the Friday night & had the Ranger board that was lovely, there was a bit of confusion at first as we ordered two sharers for 4 of us, when only one arrived & then nothing more looking like it was coming out, we went to check if maybe this one board was for 4? but no they had made a mistake & we waited until they brought another one out. \nWe were charged \u00a315 gratuity. \n\nOverall this hotel is set in a beautiful location & I would definitely love to visit again for lunch out and to take in the lovely surroundings.",

    "review_text": "=== nice hotel spoilt by the staff  ===\nI had booked another stay at your hotel for my 43rd wedding anniversary and I also booked for my mother in another room, the rooms we had were room 30 and room 19 for my mother,\nmy mother is 92 and has trouble walking, so we took her to her room and as soon as we walked in she said she could not stay there because it was so dark and depressing ( her words were\" its like somewhere you go to die\" ) so I went down to reception where she said only 1 room was left available  even though we said we would pay extra for a better room. room 21 was the only option given to us so we had to accept that room although it was unsuitable because of the large step into the bathroom and my mother struggled to get up it to the toilet. I would also like to point out that her room was NEVER serviced and when my brother rang to speak to her in room 21 the male who answered the phone said the was no one staying in room 21 !!   so it meant another trip to reception to sort that out. now it comes to our room 30 I would assume it had been used for a wedding the previous day as when we arrived there was confetti on the floor and under the bed and under the wardrobe  the bed also just looked as though it had been straightened and to our dismay we found a few bits of confetti IN THE BED I would have thought you would at least change the sheets !!!. the confetti was still in the same place when we left as was a dirty plate, by the bed was tea stains down the skirting board where it looked like someone had spilled their tea and that was still there when we left, it seems the person who cleans (or doesnt as the case seems ) does a shoddy job and has no interest in keeping up your standards for a 4 star hotel  I could not hang my dress in the wardrobe as it is too small, I can only assume people only stay for 1 day as there is very limited space for clothes etc so I kept most of my clothes in my case. on my bill I was charged bar gratuities which asked to be removed because after waiting over 20 minutes to be served I had to get up and go to reception and asked if there was any one serving and she had to sort it out , and I would just like to mention there were a lot of others complaining about having to wait ages for their drinks. I know its a dog friendly hotel and I love dogs but it seems more like a dogs kennels as there were so many which is fine but when they start to bark in reception whilst trying to have a relaxing drink by reception and barking and howling ( yes howling from a room along from my mother ) and people having a meal by reception and dogs wandering around/jumping on seats /putting their paws on the tables. on the last day at breakfast we went down and the restaurant  was empty all but one couple and we were shown to a 2 seater table with an extra chair? so when we got our food ( thats 3 plates/ 3 side plates/3 bowls / 3 cups and saucers/ 3 glasses/condiments/ and then the waitress brings our tea with no where to put it so we assumed the other tables were reserved. we even  had to put our teapot and old plates on another table as there was no room on ours. After we finished our breakfast we were asked if we wanted to move to a bigger table.we said not to bother as we had finished . Why wasn't we put on another table in the first place.we ordered coffee and when it arrived we asked if there were any biscuits with the coffee he said they haven't got any but 2 minutes later a young girl went up to him and he gave her a plate with 5 on and the couple behind us had coffee with biscuits we went to speak to the manager but he had finished his shift..  So all in all it was a terrible stay and spoiled our occasion",

We loved the gym, the outdoor pool was warm and we enjoyed the terrace with the sun loungers away from the main pool area, which was mainly families with young children. Fantastic cycling routes all around here.",

We ate in both restaurants and enjoyed our meals which were delicious (but on the pricy side). \nAfter a night of heavy rain there was a leak in our room and the duty manager couldn\u2019t have handled it better.  Within minutes we were moved to another lovely room.  This matter was dealt with beautifully. \nThe spa facilities are great and the gardens have comfortable seating. \nCannot praise the hotel and staff enough for making our stay so enjoyable.

    "review_text": "=== First year wedding anniversary stay ===\nSo we revisited the Balmer lawn for our 1 year wedding anniversary stay . The room was stunning and looked into the cricket pitch was lovely to sit out on the balcony with a drink and take up the views . We had a walk into Brockenhurst and visited some local pubs which was only a 15 minute walk which was also lovely and everyone very friendly , back to the hotel for another drink on the balcony and freshen up . We had dinner at the beresford and the food and service was 5* would recommend this or the lodge to be honest and have eaten in both and both options are great . Back to the room for another drink and 5* sleep on what I can only describe as the biggest bed ever . Has a cup of tea on the balcony to met with ponies and cows also having their breakfast which was stunning , Breakfast is also fantastic with so much to choose from and the cooked English breakfast was yummy . After leaving with my husband we had time to reflect and said that we would definitely like to do this to every year and would no doubt return to Balmer lawn, even two nights so we can enjoy the spa and pool .",

    "review_text": "=== Not the romantic get away we planned ===\nDecided to revisit this hotel 30 years after spending our first wedding anniversary there. The staff are friendly and polite. Mike the manager was  engaging and knowledgeable about the history of the hotel which was very interesting. Our little dog was welcomed as much as we were. Sausages in a special box was a delightful touch. Our evening meal of the steak was absolutely divine. Succulent, nicely presented and plentiful. The cheeseboard was expensive for what arrived, a very limited and unimaginative offering. My Calypso coffee was bitter, no sugar has been added and the cream a bit dubious. Our room was sadly like it hadn't had an awful lot done in the 30 years since we were last there. The curtains were ripped and badly watermarked on the lining. Bed linen was clean but not particularly good quality. The quilt was very thin which was a shame. No bedside lamps, the choice was a very bright ceiling spotlight. Not very romantic. The bathroom was spotless but the large bolted to the walls plastic soap  dispenser, is  not what you expect to find in a luxury, spa hotel. Completely accept that being dog friendly there has to be a slight impact on the standard of the room but being charged \u00a3200  a night, you do expect some luxury. The towels were hard and only a couple of large, no hand towel at all. The noise from the bar area ( can't call it music) was absolutely horrific. We were on the 3rd floor and the drum and  beat was pounding for hours. Again not very romantic. We had taken up the offer for fresh milk in the morning but gave up waiting as it never arrived and no-one seemed particularly bothered when I mentioned to reception that we were now down so no-one needed to go up. \n Breakfast was delicious, plenty of variety and the staff were attentive. Overall, the location is glorious, the staff are friendly but the room we stayed in was tatty and tired and badly in need of some updating.  Regretting a bit we returned and had our memory spolit of going all those years ago as definitely not the romantic get away we hoped for.",

    "review_text": "=== Food and drink are the crowning glory ===\nWe stayed at the Balmer Lawn Hotel for a week in July. Overall we really enjoyed our stay and want to give a balanced review of our experience. Firstly, the good points. \n\nThe hotel is in a lovely location situated in the heart of the New Forest within easy reach of Brockenhurst village centre. It is quiet and peaceful and you only have to walk through the side gate of the hotel to be amongst the wild ponies - perfect for walkers and cyclists.\n\nThe facilities are excellent - two pools, both clean, a small sauna and a jacuzzi. Plenty sun loungers, gardens with a zip line and outdoor games for kids. Iced lemon water is provided FOC outside for users of the pool and sunbeds. They also have a secure bike shed which is great for anyone wishing to store their bike (remember to take your own lock).\n\nThere are two restaurants with different menus and two bar areas. The food and drink really are the crowning glory of this hotel, both were excellent. We ate in the restaurant most nights as it was part of our package and weren\u2019t disappointed. Food and cocktails were fantastic, beautifully presented and delicious. We also had champagne afternoon tea which was delicious.\nBreakfast was great - hot and cold buffet, lots of food, all tasty and plenty of choice.\n\nThe staff - really lovely, polite and were as helpful as they could be during our stay, particularly the restaurant staff.\n\nNow onto some items which needed improvement. Upon arrival the welcome was rather underwhelming. No one told us about breakfast times or gave any other information than our room was on the first floor. In the room there was no welcome note or folder with any hotel specific information in it either - breakfast times, pool opening/closing times etc.\n\nThe bedrooms (well certainly ours was) are tired and need updating. There were paint splashes in the bath, the headboard was peeling and the wallpaper was coming off the wall in places. There was very little storage space in the bathrooms for toiletries and the ones provided were in cheap looking plastic bottles attached to the wall. There were 4 coat hangers in the wardrobe - fine if you\u2019re staying for one night but not ideal if you are staying for longer. The rooms do not have a safe or a fridge though they do have tea & coffee making facilities and complimentary biscuits and water. The towels/robes were stiff and cardboardy.\n\nThe first night of our stay we were told we were eating in the Lodge. We entered to find a DJ playing dance music at a volume high enough that there was no way you could have a conversation. There didn\u2019t seem to be any escape as the music was blasting through the speakers even in the side room. As a young family we found it quite bizarre that anyone would want to eat their dinner in what was basically a club minus a dance floor. Apparently this is a thing on Friday and Saturday evenings. We saw numerous people enter the Lodge only to turn around and walk out again on hearing the music. We opted to eat in the restaurant for the rest of our stay which was much more civilised.\n\nOn the second night the fire alarm went off at 2.30am. Granted I\u2019d rather have a false alarm than no alarm and there be a fire but there was no explanation about why it had happened and no apology from anyone. \nOverall we enjoyed our stay, would we stay again? Probably not.",

    "review_text": "=== Balmer Lawn Hotel and Spa ===\nThe hotel no longer lives up to its former reputation as a first grade 4 star hotel.  \nThere may be some small excusable factors such as staff difficulties, cost of maintaining standards and post pandemic difficulties that all relate to a disappointing experience on some levels. \n\n1: Firstly the bedrooms. \nThe trainee reception staff member could not have been more friendly welcoming and informative. \nThe room I had been allocated was small dark and looked onto a roof and wall. I had hoped for a bath but not requested one when booking. The staff member suggested moving me as another room that was available. She carried my luggage and brought me to a much brighter room with both bath and view. \n\n2: The standard of decor in the room. \n\nThis was Faded and dreary. The curtains  had a rip in the lining and dark plain  green walls did not display any pictures or decoration. \nThere were no water or tissues in the room nor shower cap or any individual soaps etc. \nIn the bathroom that was very clean were only large wall mounted pump action soap and shampoo dispensers. \nWhen I asked about the above I was just provided with a bottle of tap water and a box of tissues. The shower water pressure was very poor. \nThe bed was very clean and comfortable but the black leatherette headboard had  scratches and scrapes on both sides above the bed. \n3: Breakfast\n\nThe worst part about breakfast were the arrangements and planning of service. \nThere was a signing in unit opposite the main reception desk. This unit was obviously multi functional and moved about as required. This was confusing for guests checking out and those waiting to be seated. \nIn spite of a notice attached to it, asking guests to wait to be seated, guests coming down stairs could not immediately see the unit so naturally gravitated  towards part of a continental breakfast self help table. \nThe staff member seating guests had to stop guests and ask them to queue to be seated. Once seated,  inadequate instructions were given regarding how the service system worked. \nNo one told me that hot food ordered from the menu on my first day was a self service hot buffet in an alcove on the second. When I ordered poached eggs with other items from a waiter all that came after a considerable wait were two eggs on their own. When I asked where everything else was I was told it was served separately in a hot buffet alcove. \nA really helpful waitress came and carried my plate and took me to this side room where a large range of other items were indeed available. \nSo by the time I had returned to my table my coffee and breakfast were stone cold. \n\nIn summary, the staff were very friendly and courteous. However, the layout for breakfast was very confusing making the staff\u2019s job difficult. One also had the impression that there were mixed messages regarding instructions to staff. \nThe hotel needs considerable work done to bring it back to its high standards of the past.\n\nThe separate Spa and leisure facilities were excellent and totally worthy of 4 star status. Well done to them all.",

    "review_text": "=== Could be amazing, but isn\u2019t! ===\nOk I\u2019m not sure where to start here! \nWe went to this hotel after taking our cars to a  Super Car show for an impromptu  lunch.  The sun was shining, the atmosphere where we were sitting outside was charming, and there was a live singer performing an array of songs-   - so all in all a fabulous atmosphere.  \nAs business owners with chaotic lives this was a much needed escape from reality.\n \nWe then waited well over 30 mins for anyone to even take our drinks order which was frustrating.  When they finally came they promised to come back and take the food order but never returned.  \n\nAfter another  15 mins waiting, our drinks finally arrived and we asked the waiter who delivered the drinks if we could please order food with him.  It wasn\u2019t overly busy so we were unsure what the delay was.  \n\nThe food was ok.  Our son ordered a medium rare steak which arrived well done and it took another 30 minutes+  for the new one to arrive by which point the rest of the family had finished eating.  \n\nRegardless we were having a lovely chilled out time so decided to throw caution to the wind, book a room and have a few more drinks, snacks etc. \n\nOn initially entering our rooms (which cost \u00a3450) I was stunned - as an avid traveller, the room was nothing short of tatty, there were bits falling off the divan bed, the toilet roll holder was hanging off and the furniture was out of Ikea and very old and tatty.  I regretfully went to reception to see if we could change rooms.  \nReception were lovely and professional and gave us another 2 room options (there were 4 of us - 2 adults and 2 children). \n\nTo be fair the new rooms offered were marginally better, but still very poor standard when paying almost \u00a3500.  There were no lamps or any finishing touches at all and our children were in an adjoining room which was no better.  \nMy partner again said he was not impressed but the only other option was a room for us on one floor, and for our children to be on another floor which was not acceptable (we were told the hotel was very empty that evening, so we are sure there were other options available)..  I have stayed in hundreds of hotels worldwide and the furnishing etc could be so much improved for very little outlay, they really let this hotel down.  \n\nWe continued our afternoon sat outside eating, drinking and playing board games which was fantastic.  Real credit to some of the waiting staff who were professional and friendly, but others were abrupt and very standoffish.  \n\nI really really want to love this hotel as the location is fantastic but it\u2019s lacking that personal touch, attention to detail and warmth that other hotels in the area have in abundance.  \n\nThe outside and bar areas are lovely, drinks/wine list very good (we racked up a very large bill), but the rooms are extremely poor and desperately need upgrading if the owners want to charge such high rates.  \nWould I return?  Not at the current charge rate with substandard rooms.  There is so much choice in the area and competition is high.  We could have spent \u00a3200 less and got a much better standard of room.",

Instead of a leisurely drink we were now in a rush to make dinner. Maybe more staff required at weekends?

The website clearly showed the four room categories as luxury, superior, family and standard. I have a screen shot to prove this. I chose standard and paid the deposit. I made a mistake by not checking the confirmation email properly which stated \"small\" standard. Unbelievably this hotel charges the same for small standard as for standard. It is beyond me why anyone would book a small standard for the same price. On arrival we were informed that the full balance was due!! We then went our room No 1 which the hotel had allocated to us and yes it was small, very small. Nowhere to put suitcases, no wardrobe, a clothes rail with no hangers, a very poor view over hotel internal walls, a poor fan and stifling hot, and a tiny shower room with a miniscule sink. There is no way this room should be charged at the same rate as a standard. After a rather unpleasant battle we were moved after three days to a family room No 23 where we had to pay extra. This room was much larger and had air conditioning which didn't work. When we queried this at reception this we were told people steal the remotes. The loo seat was loose and some screws were sticking out at the side of the bath. The room was well furnished but the view was non existent and even worse than room No 1. A member of staff told us that room No 1 was not suitable for a six night stay. A letter to the owner will be on its way shortly. The whole debacle could have been handled in a professional manner but we were passed from pillar to post. We checked the hotel website and booking.com on a daily basis and more suitable rooms were available every day. There are some very nice features to this hotel. Nice pools, nice restaurant and bar areas and the staff were by and large pleasant but everything seemed rather uncoordinated.",

The outside terrace is beautiful and looks over the cricket pitch. There are also lots of the famous ponies roaming around. In fact they acted as an alarm clock one morning - a lovely way to wake up. We arrived early and our room wasn\u2019t ready so we asked for directions to do the pub walk as listed on the hotels website. Unfortunately the reception desk didn\u2019t seem to know what we were referring to and although she asked someone else she didn\u2019t have any luck. Not really a problem because we found it ourselves anyway. The outdoor pool is lovely and although relatively busy on the Sunday was really quiet on Monday. The food in the restaurants was nice but it was all a bit fussy  (nice if you wanted to go somewhere for a one off celebration meal) and quite expensive. We had lovely service everywhere at the hotel. Breakfast was buffet style but everything tasty and fresh. My only criticism would be the facilities in the room - very basic coffee making facilities and toiletries. Floorboards were pretty creaky but probably to be expected. Nice walk out of the back of the hotel to the Pig which is worth a visit. Overall we had the rest we were so desperate for.",

We were a little bit tired when we arrived late afternoon and it had been hard to find a parking space due to a commercial event there.  But the welcome there by Maria was first class, altering our dinner reservation, offering and bringing tea for 2 to our room, opening the lower windows which had been locked for safety, later bringing us a little chocolate birthday surprise.  \nThe restaurant experience was very good.  The staff levels picked up a bit once the aforementioned event had finished but apart from our main waiter, a restaurant of that quality should be married with sufficient staffing and a tiny bit more finesse.  But we were in no hurry and enjoyed our meal there.  Very happy with the breakfast buffet experience too.\n\nThe room was a good size with a large comfortable bed.  The 12 o'clock checkout deadline was a bonus.\n\nNot sure we solved the bathroom shower controls entirely but not a major problem.  I personally felt that the shaver point being set facing downwards on the top of the mirror fitting was not right and hard to use.\n\nBut we were very happy with the overall experience and would recommend it to friends.",

The lady who greeted us was friendly and said no issue with us having a seat on the terrace and if we decided to have food it wouldn\u2019t be an issue. \n\nThe lady waitress was friendly we had to ask for a drinks menu but this did come quickly we also asked to see a food menu just in case we decided to eat. Drinks took a while to come out with one being wrong although this was quickly changed. We then asked a couple of other staff for a food menu. The restaurant menu then came over and asked if we had booked which we hadn\u2019t he then in a very dismissive and condescending manner explained that there was no room for us to eat on the terrace and the only option was to go into the restaurant and that we should book in advance because they only had enough food for the people booked and it that we would be stealing someone\u2019s food if we went in the restaurant. I then sharply said well can we at least have a menu so we can decide what we want to do. \n\nHe then came back with the menus having already made it clear we were not welcome to stay. We all decided we didn\u2019t want to have food due to his obnoxious attitude. He had also only given us the menu for the Sunday lunch and we clearly saw other people having a varied menu on the terrace. As an aside there were plenty of empty tables on the terrace so it in no way seemed extremely busy! \n\nWe did have some drinks and might have stayed longer but overheard the restaurant manager telling the waitress she needed to move on those just having drinks as if we were second class citizens. \n\nSuch a shame if he had of been polite and explained best to book ahead we may well have returned we are also currently looking for wedding venues but this is one that is certainly not on that list.",

Breakfast is pricey \u00a320 per person per night but comparable to other similar hotels In the area.  We opted out and found a local cafe.  Dinner in Berefords was a mixed bag.

My room was a good size, well set out, and the view was out across the forest. I had arrived with enough time to enjoy a swim and sauna, in the pleasant spa, before dinner.\n\nThere does seem to be a pre-dinner drinks bar missing, or maybe I missed it, but I enjoyed a pint in the corner of a dining room before going through to the main dining room, which was definitely one of the prettiest dining rooms I have ever seen. The room is long and lean and so very well designed and decorated. A joy in itself. The food was well cooked and presented. The hotel clearly has a very good Head Chef on board, and I enjoyed my meal. Breakfast the following morning was equally as well presented.

On only 1 morning were guests accommodated in the Beresfords restaurant - when we received a full choice of all foods offered on the menu and could make our own toast, therefore, hot and fresh.  On the other 2 days toast came semi cold lying on a plate somewhat folornely ( have Balmer Lawn no toast racks)?Eggs were served semi raw and availability of foods not explained at all so that One had no idea of choice!  \n\nA particular problem for my husband and myself (and other guests One assumes) was nowhere did we have access to any information as to various features of the hotel e.g. Indoor Pool, towels, possible hire of Spa slippers etc etc.  Overall, a stay somewhat disappointing.

How they can charge this amount for such an out dated and cheaply furnished room is a scandal. \n\nThe room itself was in the atrium and not in a corridor and the noise from the communal areas was to the level that we couldn\u2019t sleep - to be clear, the noise was not inappropriate, it was people responsibly enjoying the bar and then the staff cleaning and setting up breakfast. But the room is poorly soundproofed and it was very loud. \n\nAfter raising our concerns, we were told that the next night we could go to a better room and would get \u00a350 off our bill - but we decided to check out instead. The staff refunded us which shows a great awareness of customer service which I\u2019m grateful for, but also a sense that this is an ongoing problem.\n\nMy suggestion is to either substantially reduce your prices to reflect the quality of the hotel, or significantly improve the quality of the hotel. \n\nMatt",

The first thing to say is that the staff were lovely, extremely friendly and polite without exception. Our room was a superior room, although very clean and generally well equipped we were on the first floor and could hear music from reception all day and into the night which wasn\u2019t great. Dressing gowns were provided to go down to the pool/spa but no slippers of flip flops for our feet. The main disappointment was the indoor pool. We went down to have a look after check in, walked through the door where a guy was changing a babies nappy and the pool was full of children so you couldn\u2019t really swim at all. We went down to the pool twice more and it was exactly the same. I appreciate we were there during half term but perhaps a couple of designated times for adults only would have been a good idea. In the evening we decided to go down for a cocktail before dinner. We walked into the bar and were told to sit down and we would be served. Twenty minutes later no sign of staff so had to go and find one who did apologise and gave us a cocktail menu. Nobody came back to take an order so we just left and walked into dinner. The food was excellent although a minor irritation was on five occasions staff came up with either drink or food that we hadn\u2019t ordered. Surely they must have a system for knowing which table has ordered which food or drink. Amusing on the first couple of occasions by the fifth time it was annoying.

The few poolside beds were naturally full and the jacuzzi out of order so only the sauna to use to relax. That\u2019s ok, my wife has a spa treatment booked for following morning as a bit of luxury. No, unfortunately that gets cancelled as the therapist calls sick (these things happen!). \n\nLater that evening, we have dinner booked in the Beresford restaurant. Food & drinks were very good, but service, at least for us, was poor. We were left to our own devices in the corner of the restaurant. Our theory being they were paying attention to the Valentines taster menu guests and larger groups. However being forgotten about more times than is acceptable was a kick in the teeth. By the end we just got up and left (not hanging around for the dessert menus that never came)\u2026 hearing the table next to us have a little grumble as they up departed suggests they may had a similar experience. \n\nThe pros: room was comfortable, the food and drink very good and general atmosphere/setting very nice, and actually can\u2019t fault the staff we interacted with. \n\nSadly however next year, I may just run her a nice bath, light some aromatic candles, get an M&S dine-in for 2 meal and even fluff the bed pillows\u2026  save myself a few quid and a 2 hour journey.",

We like a strong power shower, and did not have it with this one.. \n\nRestaurants are nice but very expensive - \u00a34 for 5 slices fo Sourdough bread? :(\n\nIf they made these above changes hen it would definitely rate as a 4 star. Right now, it is more a high 3 star hotel.",

The hotel and staff put a lot of effort in, not just for the evening but before and after, it was a lovely stay. Thank you very much",

    "review_text": "=== A Superb Experience. ===\nMany years ago I trained as a hotel manager but our stay at the Balmer Lawn Hotel was an unexpected experience. We had booked two nights including a gala dinner on New Years Eve. My room was small but adequate since I was on my own. The evening of the gala dinner was superb. We were addressed by Michael Clitheroe, the general manager, who was very amusing. One thing we noticed was the staff were all smiling and happy in their jobs. They all just did what needed doing with a smile, wonderful !\nAll the food we had was excellent and the service was without question. \nI had a slight problem with a strange noise in my room. I discussed the problem with Jake who, within ten minutes, moved me to another, upgraded, room. It seems to me that Mr Clitheroe knows exactly how things should work in a hotel such as this and has managed to get all the staff to respond. I thoroughly enjoyed my stay and will go back.",

    "review_text": "=== A fabulous New year ===\nThree of us visited this hotel over New Year. What a fabulous place. \nFrom the first welcome from Maria to the last goodbyes, the experience was wonderful. It seems a bit unfair to mention a few people by name because the compliments apply to every member of staff but special acknowledgement is justified too. \nWe booked the New Year function and stayed over for New Years Day and what a good decision that proved to be. \nNew Years Eve was brilliant. A high quality 6 course dinner, music and dancing provided great entertainment and each member of staff was excellent. \nAfter a day at leisure on New Years Day, sloshing around the water and mud in the New Forest, we chose to have dinner at the hotel again. Another wise decision and delightful Briony looked after us with charm and enthusiasm. Food was again excellent with my turbot outstanding. \nMichael Clitheroe, the General Manager, is clearly a quality individual. Very happy, highly motivated and efficient staff (all of them), high standard food and every appearance of a well run hotel would seem to be testament to his managerial skills. \nAn outstanding stay and we shall return",
