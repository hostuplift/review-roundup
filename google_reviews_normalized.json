Overall we really could not fault the evening and had a wonderful time. We arrived a little early but were welcomed at reception and given a map so that we could do a quick walk in the forest direct from the hotel whilst our room was being prepared. This is a great bonus - the walk is around 90 mins if you do it all and so beautiful! We were allocated a room with a lovely forest view on the third floor - it was spacious and comfy (the receptionist moved us to this floor at our request there is a lift so only one step to navigate!) We made a cuppa in our room (all provided by the hotel) and then changed into swimsuits and robes to go and enjoy the leisure pool/jacuzzi/sauna. There were a few others in there and I had to pop back to reception to get towels and to the spa to get slippers, - but all staff were very happy to help with this, so no issues. On our way back up to our room later we completed a wine and fizz order on specially prepared leaflets which we posted in a post box. Great idea and so organised! The evening started with champagne and candles at 6.30 - and we met other diners all dressed up in black tie and sparkles etc. There wasn\u2019t enough seating out at this point- but actually this forced us to chat to other people which was really good. There was a great atmosphere. We then had a delicious relaxing meal - lots of courses and very tasty food. Well done to the chefs for getting out so many meals on time and perfectly cooked! By the time we finished eating it was around 9 ish and we then had seats around a dance floor with a DJ playing lots of nostalgic music. There was now lots of seating out, a Photo Booth (brilliant fun with lots of hats glasses feathers etc to parade in whilst the camera counted down and snapped away) and a room with casino games in. We whiled away the time to midnight by dancing / spending our \u2018monopoly\u2019 money and taking pics. The time flew by with lots of laughter and fun and fizz. Such a fab night and then bacon rolls were bought out to keep us going till 1 am. The staff were brilliant throughout and really well led by the manager Tom who was very hands on and helpful ( even finding me party poppers when I left mine in the restaurant!) overall a 10 out of 10 - and topped off with a good breakfast in the morning. We will definitely return to this hotel - after March when the manager shared the spa will be renovated and extended with new facilities.",

    "review_text": "=== Balmer Lawn Hotel & Saltus Spa | Brockenhurst | New Forest ===\nVery nice hotel overall, good stay and some points to improve below.\n\nWhat went well:\n- super friendly staff. Didn\u2019t meet one staff member who wasn\u2019t exceptional\n- very good hot stone massage treatment by Emily who was very skilled and professional\n- spa facilities clean and relaxing. The pool area was quiet and relaxed. Jacuzzi had good level of bubbles\n- room was very clean and spacious\n- room had all the basic and necessary facilities\n- bed comfortable\n- nice Christmas decor around the hotel\n- breakfast range was acceptable. Enjoyed the sourdough bread. Good range of juices.\n- restaurant food was really good. The pork belly starter lovely and tender. Goats cheese salad nice but missing the walnuts. The ox cheek was very nice and the haddock and chips was excellent:  very fresh, perfectly cooked and very nice batter.\n- the Black Friday deal was good value for money at \u00a3119/night for superior double\n\nEven better if:\n- the bed in the room definitely needs replacing as the faux leather was cracked and had holes in. On first glance it appeared dirty. For a 4* hotel and \u2018superior double\u2019 room I\u2019d expect better\n- the room decor was a bit outdated\n- the room facilities did feel basic for a 4*, for example no conditioner (the 2 in 1 is definitely just shampoo effect), no little toiletries, no mini fridge, old hairdryer  and things like that. I do accept that the tea and coffee facilities looked very good but I did not actually use any.\n- the full English breakfast didn\u2019t seem super fresh which would be fine if it was buffet but the fact it\u2019s brought out means it could have been a bit fresher. My scrambled eggs were definitely not freshly made for my order and bacon was a bit dry and rubbery. Very hard black pudding which clearly been sat heated for a long time. There was no hash brown served either day with my full English.\n- the continental breakfast selection could have been a bit more varied or presented better, I found the little plate of cheese and ham to be quite underwhelming and it was not replenished as much as it could have been.\n- the breakfast coffee is not very nice at all unfortunately so I ordered a latte at an additional cost of \u00a34 and that was fine. Perhaps a 4* hotel could look at getting one of the self serve coffee machines?\n- the breakfast overall could see a lot of improvement\n- the spa facilities does not include steam room\n- the sauna is quite small so only fits 3 people comfortably\n- the pool is too small to swim and more of a dip/fun or relaxation pool\n- the showers in the changing rooms in spa and on poolside was scalding hot and I had other spa goers warn me before using that they had burnt themselves and to be careful. I tried the shower later and they were right - far too hot to use and I had to shower in the room.\n- the jacuzzi goes a bit cold if run multiple times in a row\n- our couples massage was supposed to be for us to have the massage at the same time but we were then told that we had to go one at a time due to a therapist calling in sick. When I went to the treatment room it was a hotel room converted rather than the spa room as the spa is being refurbished. The temporary treatment  room only had one bed in it anyway so I\u2019m wondering if they just didn\u2019t have the facility to accommodate the couples massage which I would have preferred to know in advance. As the spa is being refurbished we also weren\u2019t able to use the spa relaxation room.\n\nI would say at present if you\u2019re looking to book somewhere for a spa experience specifically maybe wait till the refurbishments are done or book somewhere else.\n\nOn the whole, I was really happy with my stay and enjoyed it thoroughly. I was okay with the spa facilities and felt like I had a nice time and got good use. I think I wasn\u2019t expecting a lot anyway as having looked at pictures I could see rooms were outdated etc. and was happy with the fact that the room was on deal and it was therefore good value.\n\nHowever, I would say I do not think the superior double room and hotel would be worth it at full price which is think was \u00a3240 a night.",

The evening started with canap\u00e9s, a great selection great taste (but sadly due to being, maybe in the wrong place so we only had a few) on too the main event, the room was layed out brilliantly to the theme of Elton Johns music and to his dress code, to everyone having individual replicas glass, down to a centre table dressing of a balloon rocket man, and the imitation yellow brick road running through the centre of each table, to sparkly glitter balls, every effort to absorb the atmosphere was made. The food, we both had chicken, cooked to perfection with potato and spinach, very tasty but could have added another vegetable. The sweet was very good.\nThe Young Elton John tribute was excellent and deserved the accolades at the end.\nThe hotel staff were fantastic, the evening was planned that the timings synchronised from one course to the other which was brilliant.\nAs far as the hotels organisation no fault at all.\nWhat they cannot predict is the people also attending. In front of us was the youngest table in the room, who we saw in the main bar of the Hotel drinking quite heavily.\nThis lead them to be a bit noisy, throwing items, bursting the balloons, even the nice centre piece, a bit unruly, but absolutely no fault of the hotel.\nTowards the end of the night, on of the drunk youngsters went to get up from seat but he lifted one chair leg on to my wife\u2019s foot, causing a minor bruising.\nBut the evening was great.

My husband and I took a drive out to local spa hotels in the area for a last minute getaway. We were met by Briany on reception who was so friendly, helpful and allowed us to take a look at a couple of rooms available for the next day. She was able to answer our questions and after a quick view of another hotel, we came back shortly after to book a 3 night stay. Briany spent a fair amount of time with us, her customer service is excellent.\n\nThe hotel grounds are beautiful with easy access to the New Forest for walks. We stayed in the main building of the Hotel and the room was so comfortable and quiet despite being at the front and below the bar area. Bed, pillows really comfortable and the fan was an appreciated touch in the warmer nights. The cleaners were efficient and quick whilst we were at breakfast.\n\nBeing a dog friendly hotel, our dog was greeted each morning, afternoon and evening by the staff who were all very friendly and approachable. The voucher for a sausage each morning was such a lovely touch, but may I suggest it is best to stick with a rasher of bacon or scrambled eggs instead of offering dogs sausages containing onion/garlic in future, please.\n\nThe food and drinks were excellent. Worth the 2 rotary stars they have already been awarded. Quick service and as a gluten free person, I had so much choice available to me.\n\nClaudia at the spa has magic healing hands. I treated myself to an express facial on the 2nd day of our stay. She was very helpful and accommodating to swaps/change of days for treatments requests. My husband has a deep tissue massage with her on our 3rd day and I had a full body wrap with another spa colleague, but didn't catch her name.\n\nThe pools are well kept and the indoor pool is adult only from 11am-3pm which was a really nice touch for couples or those visiting without children seeking some quiet, downtime as part of the spa experience.\n\nWe would definitely visit again.",

I hadn\u2019t made a booking and asked if they had a table. The waitress went to check with the manager and then told me I could sit on a table for four but i would have to leave in just over an hour as they needed the table back. I was a bit disconcerted but agreed as I assumed they had decided they could accommodate me. I made the effort to choose my dishes quickly, and after a few minutes the manager came over to take my order. I started speaking and asked for my starter then said \u201cand for main\u201d, then was interrupted mid sentence by the manager saying \u201cno. You can\u2019t have a starter and a main. I can bring everything together if you want but I can\u2019t do a starter and a main for you as we need you to leave by quarter to seven\u201d. I said \u201cOk, don\u2019t worry about it then, I will go somewhere else\u201d and she replied \u201cwell it is Saturday night, its a busy night\u201d. I responded, \u201cI know, but if you don\u2019t have a table then just tell me you don\u2019t have a table\u201d. I then left and easily found another great restaurant who had space for me.\n\nI was really disappointed that in the interests of money grabbing another customer the wait staff would behave this way. The menu looked great but wasn\u2019t cheap - my starter was \u00a310.50 and my main \u00a320. I don\u2019t expect to sit down to a meal in a nice restaurant and be treated like i am taking someone else\u2019s spot and need to hurry up and leave, nor indeed that i would be interrupted mid sentence and told that I could not have my meal the normal way. I come to eat out on my own to relax.\n\nThe New Forest is full of fabulous restaurants. I visit a nearby equestrian venue every year, and I now will never return to Albero Italian after this experience. There is no need when I can easily find another great restaurant where the staff have a better attitude towards their customers. I would have had no problem if I had been told that unfortunately they were fully booked, and might have tried again next time. Now, certainly not. It is never a good idea to make one customer feel like less than another.",

Very reasonable prices (paid \u00a348/ head for 2 courses each and wine) and good quality food. Do go - especially if you need gluten free options, but also if you just want some tasty Italian in a lovely atmosphere",

A beautiful small town and the hotel is just along the high street.\nYou can catch a train from London Waterloo station. Otherwise you can drive down however parking may be a bit tricky except you are a local and you know your way around.\n\nService: incredible!!! The staff were absolutely amazing, our hosts were superb, you can just feel the warmth from the time you step in through their doors.\nThey put together an amazing itinerary which included a rib charter that explored the needles at the Isle of Wight (great adventure), then the nature trail walk at the new forest where we sis some foraging with Jenny who is  highly knowledgeable about the entire region.\nWe then did a mocktail making class within the Salt Bar of the Hotel, before finishing with a yummy delectable dinner at their orangery restaurant.\n\nThe next morning was a yoga class, breakfast and painting session before we finally checked out.\n\nThere are loads of different things to do around here which is exciting. You can catch the ferry to isle of wight, Yarmouth etc\n\nLoads of cafes, with freshly made pastries dotted all around! High street shops available.\n\nRooms: my room was so nicely done, had everything in it plus some very lovely welcome packages. The shower was great and super effective water pressure you almost don't want to come out of there.\nThe beds are so comfortable and lush, I had a great night sleep, the only thing missing from the room was slipper and bathrobe. Loved the decor and toiletries \ud83e\udd29\n\nGreat meeting room tucked away by the hotel garden, warm reception area and lounge areas in the Salt bar.\nI would definitely recommend it as it feels like a home away from home!\nRelatively good pricing and the menu was well accommodating for vegetarians as well.\n\nFood: Great tastes and flavours, the creme brulee was divine and the chocolate cookie was freshly made and yummy. Thoroughly enjoyed the dining experience.\n\nIf you are around town and would like somewhere lovely to stay if visiting the isle of wight and not wanting to stay there, this will be the go to recommendation \u2764\ufe0f",

The menu is excellent making it hard to choose what to have. Deciding to go for the sharing platter and some salt and pepper squid. When the sharing platter arrived I was speechless! It was simply incredible with a lot of care going into the presentation, showing casing the highest quality ingredients. The salt and pepper squid was also excellent and very fresh. Have to say the platter is enough for two without any extras.\nThe service was excellent with a great wine recommendation.\nOverall a very memorable visit for all the right reasons.\nWill definitely come back again to try more dishes from the wonderful menu.\nThank you \ud83d\ude42",

Just the two of us this time but glad to see that everything we love about this place still remains but the renovation has also elevated the place, especially the rooms which are now gorgeous (we had an upstairs garden room). The new Salt bar in the place of an under-used restaurant area on the right as you enter, is also a great addition and seemed very popular. Service all round is still super-attentive and really makes the stay. Breakfast gives plenty of choice and at high quality with hot options cooked to order from a varied menu from full English through to haddock.

On arrival we were greated by the reception team, it would have been better if there was a reception desk in the main entrance and not in the conservatory were drinks were being served. A bit chaotic with booking in, being given a drink, waiting around for someone to show us to our table and trying to find somewhere to sit to enjoy our drink.\nOnce seated I noted how low the seating was, thankfully there was a cushion to sit on, if you're short you might struggle.\nWe had a tasty array of nibbles to start with, were presented with the wine list and it did take some time for wine to arrive. Our pre-ordered starter arrived and it was very tasty and beautifully presented. We opted for the duck cooked three ways. I chose the monk fish for the main and I'm glad I did. Light and served with a sauce that was a bit rich but tasty in all. My partner opted for traditional turkey and he was pleasently surprised by the portion size (needless to say we ended up bringing leftovers). Had the panna cotta to finish with and despite it being light I was sated and couldn't manage to finish it. Sadly we were too full for coffee.\nAll in all we did enjoy it and we're glad it didn't last for hours. Christmas meals under previous owners have seen us trying to leave after five hours.\nSadly lacking in disabled fascilities. I appreciate this is a listed building but arrangements could be made to accommodate.\nQuite expensive at \u00a395 a head but worth it as a treat.",

The restaurant in particular has a very nice feel to it. The staff are friendly and professional. There are really nice wines at good prices. The food was excellent, I had hand caught scallops to start and then monkfish for main. The samphire side dish was one of the best I have had. The staff are very friendly, attentive and helpful.

Beautifully decorated and layed out. Wonderful outdoor area too.\n\nReally good looking menu, though we only had some lite bites.\n\nThoroughly recommend the \"Stanwell Garden\" cocktail, dangerously easy to drink despite being a double measure of gin!\n\nThanks to Mike for an entertaining chat, and to all other staff who were very nice and friendly.",

    "review_text": "=== Stanwell House Hotel ===\nI recently had a meal with my family at a hotel, and I must say that the overall experience left a bitter taste in our mouths. The culmination of our evening was marred by an appalling incident that showcased the hotel's lack of basic customer service and consideration.\n\nAfter enjoying our meal, we approached the hotel staff to request a taxi for our journey home. To our surprise, instead of assisting us promptly, we were directed to walk to the high street to find a taxi ourselves. This was incredibly inconvenient, especially after a long and tiring evening. It seemed unreasonable that a supposedly reputable establishment could not spare a few moments to arrange a taxi for its guests.\n\nReluctantly, we embarked on a one-hour wait outside in the biting cold, desperately trying to keep ourselves warm while anxiously anticipating transportation. The fact that we were left to endure such discomfort and inconvenience was utterly disheartening. It seemed as though the hotel had no regard for our well-being or satisfaction as guests.\n\nWhat baffled us the most was the hotel's apparent inability or unwillingness to book a taxi for us. It is a fundamental expectation that a hotel should provide reliable transportation options to its patrons, particularly when requested. The lack of initiative displayed by the hotel staff in this matter was completely unacceptable.\n\nThis unfortunate incident left a lasting negative impression on our entire dining experience. The meal itself may have been satisfactory, but it is undeniable that the way our evening concluded overshadowed any positive aspects. The hotel's failure to address our transportation needs effectively showed a severe lack of professionalism and customer care.",

It sits somewhere between The Pigs and Harbour Hotels I'd say.\n\nFit and finish of rooms and the entire hotel is to a very high standard. Rooms and bathroom facilities are really excellent. Our room (family room, 22) was a beautiful place to stay. The main bedroom was well designed and appointed if a little cramped when adding the required cot. Bed super comfy. Bathroom was wonderful. And the extra little child annex with built in bunk was a dreamy little den.\n\nStaff are attentive and helpful. Could probably take a leaf out of The Pigs' relaxed vibe rather than maintain the rather more stuffy nature of a Harbour Hotel. It was sometimes down to individual differences with staff rather than an overall sense. Maybe we just prefer normal rather than stuffy, but I appreciate it's a hard balance to strike for hotels and given the location.\n\nBreakfast was lovely and relaxed. Sunday lunch was outstanding. The best we've had for quite a while.\n\nOnly real downside is limited parking off site, but that's down to it's central Lymington location really. We were lucky as there was space during our stay.\n\nWould definitely stay again and think it represents good value for the more premium price.",

We were checked in promptly and given direction to our rooms.\n\nThe lobby and the dining room looks like it had been furnished by the Range and Dunelm. Cheap looking clock above reception desk. Random photo on canvas of Trinity College, Dublin on the stairs. Parrots on the bar lounge chairs. I was expecting more of a grand country house/ modern interior.\n\nThe inside of the lift is covered in rust and one of the first impressions when first going up to your room.\n\nI expected the rooms to look a bit dated, as I did look at the website but I thought overall, the value was good, though the rooms were not as appealing as its competitors. The bed was a faux leather base which was peeling and was the first thing you notice when you walked in the room.  The mattress's zipped together were hard and you could feel a couple of springs. The pillows were too thin and of poor quality.\nwhite plastic kettle. The dark brown,  reproduction antique furniture was scratched, leather chair in the room was incredibly warn. Peeling wallpaper. No full length mirror. We found the room to be too warm, there was a dusty fan in the room but this was an industrial fan meant to cool a large room in the day. When turned on it was too loud and would have disturbed our neighbours as well adding more disruption to our sleep. We had to sleep with the windows and curtains open.\n\nThe shower had a small head with appalling pressure and not what you expect in a country spa hotel in 2024. I notice you don't include pictures of your superior room bathrooms while boasting the 'transparency' in your website. All towels were crispy and tired.\n\nOn both nights we ate in the hotel, the food, drinks and service were impeccable and we had a lovely evening.\n\nIn the morning, after a great breakfast. I asked reception if you had different pillows or able to put some extras in the room. We were told they would be in our room at some point but they never arrived. I didn't want to look like a pillow diva so I didn't chase it at bedtime. Also, after breakfast I called reception and asked if we could book an afternoon tea, we were told we had to book the day before. It would have been beneficial to us (and your business) to be asked if we wanted this when we checked in.  We both wanted treatments that day in the spa but were told that we couldn't have these either. We compromised and said we would have treatments the day we were leaving and were told we would get a call from the spa to arrange but nobody called us. We spent \u00a3400 on treatments down the road in a different spa.\n\nYour website and YouTube promos shows better beds by the pool and people drinking champagne in the jacuzzi, which you're not allowed to do which is a bit misleading. Ladies changing room had black mould and loo door filthy. Ceiling in pool area brown and mouldy in places, extractors loose and rattling. Small kids using the pool after their time and in the sauna and jacuzzi.\n\nThe food and kind service prevented our stay from feeling like a complete disaster but our room and not being able to get a treatment or afternoon tea was disappointing.\n\nWe booked this as a treat for me while I've been  recovering from surgery and having an awful year. The tired, 1997 vibes room, the sorry and misleading spa and having to go elsewhere to get what the hotel offers itself, put a damper on our stay.\n\nAll your staff are a real asset. Adam, In particular was first class. He really cared and understands hospitality and people, what Adam has you can't teach. Please pass on how impressed we were and thank him for us.\n\nIf the hotel d\u00e9cor was less confused the rooms and spa were up to standard for the area and price, I would return in a heartbeat.\n\nEdit: It's been over a month and the manager has not reached out to me as he said he would in his reply to the review.",

They have a covered area outside which has a lovely mix of wood and white lights, with heaters, it has a very nice feel to it.\n\nOn entering the hotel, there is a small reception area and a beautiful staircase. On the occasion we visited, there was a massive, beautiful Christmas tree stetching up the well of the staircase.  The atmosphere is cosy, warm and welcoming.\n\nThe room was outstanding.  We had a suite with a lounge area and a four-poster bed.  It was immaculately clean, and the bed was genuinely one of the most comfortable I have ever slept in.  The bathroom was awesome with a very big, deep bath and a beautiful walk-in shower.  There were modern high end tv's in both the bedroom and the lounge area.  It could do with a little updating, with respect to the decor or fittings and fixtures (excluding the bathroom) but it does not, in any way, detract from the room itself.\n\nWe had dinner in the restaurant.  I had the panchetta soufle and the filet stake accompanied with a bottle of red.  It was one of the best meals I've had.  The soufle was stunning and the steak cooked to perfection.\n\nThe pool and gym area are well kept and tidy, there are a few things like wiping the pvc windows or repairing some of the tiling, which would only add to the ambience.\n\nThe thing that set all of this apart from other 4 star, 2 rosette hotels, is the service.  All of the staff, and I genuinely mean all of them, have been friendly, kind, courteous and the whole time. Absolutely first class service.\n\nI would highly recommend this hotel spa.",

The breakfast was great whether opting for the \"full English\" or opting for the continental alternative.  I had the  generous Sunday roast whilst my wife trusted the chef and went with a cod dish that she thought was excellent.   The pool can be busy esp if the weather is bad outside so do choose your timings.\n\nA final mention for the hard working team (seen and unseen).  Thank you.",

It was decorated brilliantly for Halloween \ud83c\udf83\nI had asked for a quiet room which we received. It was very clean and good housekeeping. There wasn't any heating in the room. There appeared to be a boxed in radiator under the window, which wasn't on, and nowhere to adjust it!\nThere was a heated rail in the bathroom, thankfully. The plug in the bath was stuck in the plughole, so we had to use a spoon to release the water after bathing. We did notify reception.\nThe staff were all very nice and the hotel is situated in a lovely location.\nAlthough the presentation and evening meals were delicious, there was a long wait. We were told the first evening by the young lady waitress that she would not put our order through as she did not want to overload the kitchen staff.  At that point, there were only five tables seated in the main restaurant. On the second evening, we ordered two cold desserts, one being ice cream.  We waited thirty minutes and had not received them, so we cancelled our order.\nOverall, it was a nice stay.",

And hardly any function rooms. Not even where they bride dressed!! All had a small fan. Everyone asked for extra fans and they ran out. The hotel appeared full,  on the Saturday there was a wedding and another party going on so maybe it was to be expected that despite asking for an iron and board twice, it never appeared.  The food however was good. The wedding breakfast good quality and nicely cooked and the breakfast very good. Good recreational facilities if that\u2019s what you are there for but I did find it disconcerting to see scantily clad swimsuit wearing sunbathers blatantly stood watching the private wedding ceremony. All in all, of course I had a fab time at the wedding but,  would I return to this hotel in the summer months if there wasn\u2019t a wedding. Not a chance!

    "review_text": "=== Balmer Lawn Hotel & Saltus Spa | Brockenhurst | New Forest ===\nWe stayed at the Balmer Lawn Hotel for a week in July. Overall we really enjoyed our stay and want to give a balanced review of our experience. Firstly, the good points.\n\nThe hotel is in a lovely location situated in the heart of the New Forest within easy reach of Brockenhurst village centre. It is quiet and peaceful and you only have to walk through the side gate of the hotel to be amongst the wild ponies - perfect for walkers and cyclists.\n\nThe facilities are excellent - two pools, both clean, a small sauna and a jacuzzi. Plenty sun loungers, gardens with a zip line and outdoor games for kids. Iced lemon water is provided FOC outside for users of the pool and sun beds. They also have a secure bike shed which is great for anyone wishing to store their bike (remember to take your own lock).\n\nThere are two restaurants with different menus and two bar areas. The food and drink really are the crowning glory of this hotel, both were excellent. We ate in the restaurant most nights as it was part of our package and weren\u2019t disappointed. Food and cocktails were fantastic, beautifully presented and delicious. We also had champagne afternoon tea which was delicious.\nBreakfast was great - hot and cold buffet, lots of food, all tasty and plenty of choice.\n\nThe staff - really lovely, polite and were as helpful as they could be during our stay, particularly the restaurant staff.\n\nNow onto some items which needed improvement. Upon arrival the welcome was rather underwhelming. No one told us about breakfast times or gave any other information than our room was on the first floor. In the room there was no welcome note or folder with any hotel specific information in it either - breakfast times, pool opening/closing times etc.\n\nThe bedrooms (well certainly ours was) are tired and need updating. There were paint splashes in the bath, the headboard was peeling and the wallpaper was coming off the wall in places. There was very little storage space in the bathrooms for toiletries and the ones provided were in cheap looking plastic bottles attached to the wall. There were very few coat hangers in the wardrobe - fine if you\u2019re staying for one night but not ideal if you are staying for longer. The rooms do not have a safe or a fridge though they do have tea & coffee making facilities and complimentary biscuits and water. The towels/robes were stiff and cardboardy.\n\nThe first night of our stay we were told we were eating in the Lodge. We entered to find a DJ playing dance music at a volume high enough that there was no way you could have a conversation. There didn\u2019t seem to be any escape as the music was blasting through the speakers even in the side room. As a young family we found it quite bizarre that anyone would want to eat their dinner in what was basically a club minus a dance floor. Apparently this is a thing on Friday and Saturday evenings. We saw numerous people enter the Lodge only to turn around and walk out again on hearing the music. We opted to eat in the restaurant for the rest of our stay which was much more civilised.\n\nOn the second night the fire alarm went off at 2.30am. Granted I\u2019d rather have a false alarm than no alarm and there be a fire but there was no explanation about why it had happened and no apology from anyone.\n\nOverall we enjoyed our stay, would we stay again? Probably not.",

Facilities were good, great breakfast, indoor pool not huge but decent enough, outdoor pool felt nice and warm but had the cover on the second day we were there for some reason.  Staff were friendly and attentive.\n\nThe not good:\nFeels like it's well overdue a refresh.  Our room was an ok size, but a locked connecting door to the next room didn't block much of the sound.  Bathroom had a cracked sink, broken extractor fan, cobwebs in the corners.  Bedroom furniture is from IKEA and doesn't scream of quality, wardrobe doors felt very rickity.  The desk top had loads of ripples in it from water damage.  One of the double glazed windows had blown so was misted up.\n\nRestaurant has deer antler  chandeliers which on mildly closer inspection are all plastic.  Little things like this just don't scream quality.\n\nGiven local competition like Carey's Manor they need to up the quality.  We paid around \u00a3280 on average for our room for 2 nights and I wouldn't have said it was worth that given my comments above, probably 15-20% too high in hindsight.\n\nHate leaving reviews with negativity and hope they progress.\n\nWould stay again if they had a refurb",

As my review stated over all disappointing. The waitresses and staff in general were friendly, polite and trying to do their best . I enquired after the name of your drinks/ manager, as when he realised that we had been served drinks in glass containers by the pool by his staff he became very rude and offensive muttering under his breath and took away our drinks. When we enquired what on earth he was doing he began to raise his voice and argue with us. Did I mention the vegan menu? It appears that chef adapts the normal menu to fit in with a vegan menu ,which disappointed those members of my family who are vegan as it became a very poor choice of what was available. My last comment must be as we were all sitting having breakfast the couple sitting next to us appeared to be unable to control their dog as he continually jumped up and sat on their table 2or 3times. So yes these are the reasons that our visit to you was disappointing and fell short of our expectations.",

We had our pup and our friend had his, who is very nervous of strangers. When the server came over and the dogs began barking he waited patiently for them to calm, then gained their good graces with treats!!

This is the service followed:.\nOrdered drinks - drinks arrived ok - waitress polite and friendly\nOrdered food -  the knives and forks arrived and then food arrived on hot stones - we then had to ask for plates.\nNo tongs or forks where given for turning and cooking whilst cooking and for dishing out food.  This is not good practice when people are moving food around the hotplate after the fork has been in there mouths.  When I asked for tongs the lad just shrugged his shoulders.\nNo one came and asked us if we wanted more drinks.\nToilets/Cleanliness - one of the most important thing when eating out and are a big thing for us, - the ladies were fine but the gents were disgusting my son had to hold his nose and my husband wouldn't use them.

Both were reported as very nice, but we had quite a lot left over as the portions were very generous. One meal to share would have easily been enough for my two children, so something to think about if you are feeding under 5s.\n\nService was quick by friendly and cheerful waitresses.\n\nWe've eaten out somewhere different every night this week in the New Forest, and we was slightly gutted that we only found this place the night before heading home - 100% the best place we've eaten all week! Will be back if we are in the area again.\n\nOnly downside in my opinion is that it wasn't easy to book a table. I called twice (no answer), so submitted a \"request\" for a table via the website, but my table was never confirmed in the two hours that followed (presumably no one at the pub looked at the request). In the end we just turned up, and we're immediately seated, so it wasn't an issue. But it was 530 in the evening, and I suspect we may have been turned away if it was a bit later on, say, a Friday night. Perhaps you could invest in a better booking system that provides real time availability....",

Disgusting attitude, avoid at all costs we had already spent over \u00a3200 on drinks and would not accommodate our 2 specials orders, management need a course on customer service and how to add value to their business by being more accommodating!

Delicious.\nWe both had the Steak hot plate.\nThe meat was lovely,  excellently cooked by me \ud83e\udd23. The sides were lovely and great portion sizes.\nI CAN NOT RECOMMEND THIS PLACE ENOUGH.\nThe staff were all friendly and helpful.",
