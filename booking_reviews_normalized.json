Room was clean with a comfortable bed.Nice bathroom with lovely toiletries.Restaurant food was outstanding and it was nice to receive a birthday sweet treat ....good communication as I'd only mentioned on the phone  briefly the  week before.\nDisliked: Although if is made very clear that parking is on a first come basis we found it really annoying we had to pay with no reimbursement from the hotel,while there were 2 cars in the carpark with no hotel voucher on show. Seems an unfair system to me that some will pay for parking and some won't.\nOur rooms in the attic area, I suppose, were price point relevant but my brother in the opposite room and myself, who are both reasonably tall spent any time in the room hunched over because of the sloping ceilings. It was really uncomfortable! I had no view onto the high street, there seemed to be white hoardings in the way which were ugly and made me feel quite claustrophobic. I will say that Joseph rang a minute after we got in the room and I did say it was fine but I'd barely had a chance to glance around before he rang. \nFinally, my sister in law put a pair of jeans on a wardrobe shelf and the shelf collapsed. Considering it's a fairly new refurbishment I do think furniture, fixtures and fittings should be to a good standard.",

Our warm quiet  room  was very well furnished and decorated, with attention to detail. It overlooked a garden terrace, well lit and quiet in  stormy December\r\n\r\n Staff were very warm friendly and welcoming. The pride with which our room was cared for by  housekeepers was noticeable. All that we used was  refilled each day. Delivering fresh milk to our room each morning was a lovely touch.\r\n\r\n The breakfast menu was large and varied and again staff were very attentive to guests needs. We were able to linger and avoid the storms,  as there was plenty of space to accommodate all residents.\r\nThe bars were busy early in the evening but once casual dinners departed the hubbub subsided. We  enjoyed drinking in The Salt bar with its  log  burning  stove, although prices were on the high side.\r\nOver our long weekend we only dined in the hotel once. The meal was excellent and the portions substantial. Good value for money given the quality on offer.\r\n\r\nWe loved our brief say in Lymington and plan to return to the excellent Stanwell House Hotel  in the year to come.",

Great pillows linen towels etc. We had drinks on both nights in the Salt Bar and were looked after by a super attentive friendly bar tender Marino. \nWe had breakfast and this was also top notch lots of choice and once again very attentive staff. On my birthday we ate in the Samphire restaurant it was superb. Lovely atmosphere and once again great staff. They even provided me with a surprise gift that was a nice touch.

The main bar tender was excellent but on his own which meant the bar was strewn with dirty glasses needing clearing away which you don\u2019t want to see when ordering nice drinks at a premium price. The only other piece of feedback the haddock for breakfast was almost ridiculous when it arrived, the tiniest piece of fish and only one egg even though the description described eggs plural. It was the same price as everything else but was unacceptable in terms of a portion, so much so it felt like a mistake. All other breakfasts were perfect but this dish needs to be reconsidered.

In particular our drinks were served very late for dinner - the aperitif arrived when I was finishing my starter missing the point of an aperitif. The wine was delayed until well into the main course. I pointed out the delayed aperitif to the member of staff who served it who said condescendingly \u201cit\u2019s not my fault - I work in the bar\u201d as if it was funny and that somehow made it OK. He did not take my observation seriously. A minor altercation followed - I made the point it doesn\u2019t matter where he worked in the hotel but he continued being defensive with his \u201cit\u2019s not my fault, I only work in the bar\u201d excuse - he was patronising and obnoxious.

If you\u2019re taking a dog you can only stay in the terrace rooms - the listing on booking.com doesn\u2019t specify, so allowed us to book a non dog friendly room (even though I selected bringing a pet). It was only when I asked the hotel about the dog charge that they told me our room wasn\u2019t suitable - we could\u2019ve just turned up and been stuck! This isn\u2019t necessarily a hotel issue (more booking.com) but a big flaw when trying to book. The hotel also told me they couldn\u2019t do anything about it even though I\u2019m fairly sure they can reject a booking so I could\u2019ve booked the correct room\u2026 anyway we ended up not taking the dog!

It has a well stocked bar that  gets very busy at 6 pm for pre dinner drinks  .Staff were well turned out in uniforms .Fresh milk was provided outside our door in the morning .Our room overlooked the main street which was busy on the Saturday with a market but quiet when we retired to bed .We had an issue in the restaurant (see below )  which was dealt with by the manager swiftly and with courtesy\nDisliked: When a hotel charges a premium rate you expect attention to detail .We were told that the restaurant was fully booked and we were offered the orangery In fact the orangery was probably a better option although we saw tables in the restaurant that were unused . The menus were exactly the same so no problem .However we returned our fish that was either not fully cooked or was not fresh .It was tough /stringy rather than flakey  .This was returned but this time the new potatoes and carrots were not fully cooked . One of our deserts was also returned . The word is that a new chef is starting and will bring out a new menu . Staff are rushed off their feet as the new forest has difficulty attracting hospitality labour especially post brexit .",

The breakfast staff were fast, efficient, and friendly. The breakfast space had enough space, and there's a patio nearby where you can also choose to sit.\nDisliked: Getting to the second-floor room with large bags was  a bit cumbersome because of the narrow stairwell and hallway. It's manageable, though. The room was a bit on the small side too, which made it a bit hard to navigate with big suitcases filling up the space. The lock to the room was difficult to use to get into the room. Parking was hard to find upon arrival. We had to park in short-term parking across the street (once we found it). Once we did, we asked at the front desk, and they directed us to their parking lot, which was nearby, across the street. The parking was easy enough to use (once we knew where it was), but the spots can fill up fast, so there's a chance you might not get a spot there. However, if that happens, you can still pay for parking in the long-term public parking lot that adjoins the hotel's parking lot.",
